I wonder how other developers manage their freelance business. Maybe I could shoot out a few emails and ask them?

Dear Freelancer,

Hello, I've been a rails developer now for a while and I found you through. Could I ask you a couple questions about your freelance business?

- how you find work?
- how you manage your time?
- how you manage customer support
- how you manage money?
- who else do you work with?
- what happens when times are slow / full?
- does guest blog posting help get you work?
- what is your freelance goal?
