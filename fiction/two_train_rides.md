# the Two Train Rides

There is a special town that everyone knows about. It is the best place to live. It has big walls to keep it safe. It is fun and full of good people. Today the town has invited anyone who wants to live in it to come. 

The only way to get to town is to take a train that is headed North. The nearby train station is giving free tickets to anyone who wants to go to town. The only decision you have to make is which train you want to ride to town. 

There are two trains that are headed North. 

The first train headed North is nice and easy and you don't have to work. It's called the fun train. However, there is a sign in front of the Fun train that says this train is headed off a cliff. There are a lot of people on the fun train. Those people tell their friends to pick the fun train. The fun train is loud, full of food, friends, and fun. As such, people don't believe that the train is headed off a cliff because the Fun train is headed north. They figure that a train wouldn't really drive off a cliff. Plus there are lots of people on this train.

The other train is rugged, rusted, and you have to work. It's called the faith train. It has a sign that says "this train will take you to town." People read this sign but this ride doesn't look as fun and figure the Fun train is headed to town too.

The whistle blows and both trains begin moving. The fun train is so big that it begins slowly. The faith train can keep up. While both trains are still moving slowly some people decide to ride the other train. 

There comes a time when the fun train uses all it's power to speed fast enough that people do not want to jump off. The Fun train uses food, fun, and friends to get people to forget that it is headed off a cliff. People forget the cliffs and enjoy the fun ride. 

the faith train doesn't have all the things the fun train has. The ride is slow, hard, and quiet. All the faith train has is a brochure that reminds them about the cliffs and the town. 

Sure enough the time came when the faith train caught up to the fun train when it was burning in the cliffs below. the faith train kept chugging along toward town. At that point the people on the faith train were glad they chose to ride the train that got them to town rather than focus on the ride.

when the faith train arrived to town they were happy to discover that it was better than the brochure described. The food was better than the fun train. The good people were happy to have more people there. And they all lived happily ever after.
