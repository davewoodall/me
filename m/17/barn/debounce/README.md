Implement a `debounce()` function

A way to rate limit how often an fn get executed.

## Goals

- understanding how variables are scoped in javascript (function scope), and how closures are formed

- understanding variable and function hoisting

- understanding invocation context ( `this` ), how it works and how it can be manipulated using `call`, `apply`, and `bind`

- understanding how functions can be used as constructors and the constructor function relationship with the keyword `this`

### Assignment;



- setup jasmine suite

- write specs for debounce()

    _part of that figuring out what debounce does_

- implement / make tests pass
