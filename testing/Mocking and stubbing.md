Mocking and stubbing

## Mocking

Mocking is a technique for calling a method that is inside another method. You expect it to be called but you don't use it's actual results. You just want to make sure the pieces are connected

## Stubbing
Stubbing is when you make the object or method a fake method. It's a placeholder for something that is not the focus of the test.

Minitest comes with two methods `stub` and `stubs`.

## GEMS

`mocha`
`shoulda`
