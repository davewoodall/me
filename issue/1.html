            Welcome to Issue 1 of my magazine!
          </p>

          <p class='p'>
            A magazine is not just a fancy term for a blog. A typical blog adheres to the same layout and design with every post. A magazine changes layout and design to fit the content. I’m starting a magazine to practice _Progressive Enhancement_ and help me focus on the things that important to me.
          </p>

          <p class='p'>
            Progressive Enhancement is a fancy way of saying that content should drive design. As a web developer, I need a place to practice Progressive Enhancement. My hope is that the content I’ve written is the easiest to design around since I wrote it.
          </p>

          <p class='p'>
            The second reason I want to start a magazine is because the majority of my free time is seeking to grow as a person. As a result, I am discovering new things on a daily basis. Those ‘things’ are little bits and pieces that help me toward bigger goals. A magazine documents where I’ve come from and where I’m headed.
          </p>

          <p class='p'>
            Publishing a magazine will also help me from getting distracted. I can be guilty of favoring the shiny new idea over the older, better one that I should really be focusing on. I would prefer to ship one idea than have 5 half-baked ideas with nothing to show for. Sticking to a deliverable will keep me accountable to the things that are most important to me.
          </p>

          <p class='p'>
            Of course, this is only the first issue. What am I saying, there is no issue yet, just this optimistic editorial piece about my forthcoming successful magazine.
          </p>

          <p class='p'>
            Thanks for reading,
          </p>
