# Infinite Surface area

The knowledge required to be a programmer is nearly unmeasurable. As a professional developer I put a certain timeline that I should just pick up and know things after a certain period of time. However, I’m beginning to see that knowledge is as much a requirement of the culture in which we work. If knowledge transfer is not an active core value, people end up working in the dark, which means they go slower than those in the know. I am not comfortable with this and I am trying to figure out how to help the overall community. However, I want to start with me. I’m trying to maintain a daily posture around 4 commitments;

1. Show up everyday
I am here and willing and able to help. I am curious in every facet of the code base. Depending on how management has organized the team will determine how narrow or broad my responsibilities are. Up to this point in my career, I find that  responsibilities are pretty broad

2. Ask thoughtful questions
It is up to me to think about where my knowledge gaps are and be ready to fill them when the opportunity presents itself. These questions don’t have to be as much real time as much as they need to be articulated. Take some time to write out questions like
- what do we do here?
- what are the key concepts?
- what is the broadest level of visibility I should know?
- Is there a particular area of the team that needs TLC?
- Is there a place in the code I could become a domain expert?

3. Be honest about what I don’t know
This is probably the scariest part yet once you realize that you are not the only one without 100% knowledge then you can be more comfortable. It actually helps others in a few ways. First, it helps set expectations. Second, if it’s important that you know this, then they will help you. Third, that level of confession should provide a mental bookmark should this subject come up again. If something comes up twice, then it’s probably worth taking some time to learn it.

4. Accept the task
Knowing that no environment is perfect nor likely ever will be, when it comes time to being assigned something, accept it. The above context and attitude will be known and when it’s time to be handed something - simply apply the above three views to the ticket handed. Show up, ask questions, admit where you’re lost. 

## Bro, you don’t know X?
I know I’m not the only one afraid of ridicule. I’ve been coding for over 5 years now and I still haven’t hit all the things I want and need to know. After taking time to reflect on this, I can see that my professional peers are in the same situation. Depending on their interest and experience will determine what they know. That’s what makes us a team. Thankfully, I have not met anyone who has conveyed this attitude that I’m afraid of encountering. I think it’s an insecurity that I’m overcoming as I finish this post.
