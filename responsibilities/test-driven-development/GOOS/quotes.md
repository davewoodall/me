## Forward

> What if software wasn’t “Made”, like we make a paper airplane - finish folding it and fly it away? What if, instead we treated software more like a valuable, productive plant, to be nurtured, pruned, harvested, fertilized, and watered?
> - Kent Beck

I’ve ben using the term ‘Garden’ for years so it was so cool to read this analogy!

## Preface

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works
> - John Gall

> Writing a test first forces us to clarify our intentions, and we don’t start the next piece of work until we have an unambiguous description of what is should do.

> Use the contents of the tests to stay focused on making progress and feedback from the tests to raise the quality of the system

## Part I introduction

> TDD is a deceptively simple idea: Write the tests for your code _before_ writing the code itself.

> We say deceptively simple because this transforms the role testing plays in the development process and challenges our industry’s assumptions about what testing is for.

> Testing is no longer just about keeping defects from the users; instead it is about helping the team to understand the features that the users ned and to deliver those features reliably and predictably.

> When followed to its conclusions, TDD radically changes the way we develop software and, in our experience, dramatically improves the quality of the systems we build, in particular their reliability and their flexibility in response to new requirements
