# coding for bloggers

thesis: Building a magazine is a different approach to blogging as a coder. It is a way for a programmer to do a few things;
- practice progressive enhancement
- declare the topics that are important to focus on for a set timeframe (30 days) which helps eliminate half-baked ideas
- have something to show for their digital life, which is in essence what a blog is. 
- writing is not just about the content. it is also about the elements, classes, styles, and scripts. which is what coders like to write.
