front end patterns

Thinking of the common front end design patterns. My first thought is to break them up by size;

### big
- page
- section
- nav
- columns
- grid

### medium
- article
- list
- header

### small
- specific elements


## requirements
- responsive
- semantic
- performant
- flexible
