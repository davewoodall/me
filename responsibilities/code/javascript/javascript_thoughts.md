# Javascript

Many of my backend dev friends say "This is the year I'm going to learn JavaScript" with the nobilest of intentions. I'm guilty of saying that a few times. Rails is what got me into web development so JavaScript has fallen under the required banner. Whereas, other devs might not hold such high devotion.

I'm constantly thinking about leveling up my javascript. One of the ways I do that is try to break down my ignornance in such a way that makes it easier to progress. As of today (2/4/2017) I feel like the langauge’s challenges for people is not as much what it is, but how it interacts in various environments. Javascript doesn’t seem to be all that impressive if left to itself. It’s how it’s grasped onto other essential concepts that it has it’s hands in everything. It reminds me of Brian Reagan’s [bit about the cranberry salesman]().

So, off the top of my head, here are some of the other areas that are needed to be comfortable with to say I know javascript well.

- How it interacts with the DOM
- How to test JS
- How it interacts with the Server
- How it interacts with HTML
- How it interacts with CSS
- How it interacts with Templates

This, to me is the part of actually applying the language. The actually peddling of the bike after spending hours learning the mechanics of the riding a bike. 

## Use cases

Another thought I had yesterday after reading the [backbone]() documentation is the use case. 

> Backbone.js aims to provide the common foundation that data-rich web applications with ambitious interfaces require

That got me thinking… At this moment, _none_ of even my pet projects think in these terms. I need to make sure I’m using the tools as they are designed. 

## Not shiny

Another thought I realized is that reading source code is not helpful unless you’re learning something. I am guilty of moving onto the next new shiny JS hotness while forgetting that I don’t even have the fundamentals down. It’s a stretch to say it this way, but I’m reminded of the Steven Covey idea that you should focus on your area of influence, not area of awareness. My influence is not learning to consume the next JS framework. My influence on myself is learning the tedious details of the language so that I become comfortable as needed. I need to focus on the fundamentals and they are neither shiny or new. 

That list includes;
- 
- Re-writing UnderscoreJs.org with ECMAScript 5 to practice testing, learning various aspects of Underscore. And how those things are implimented.

- Depending on how well that goes, I would look to doing a similar exercise with Backbone. 

Reasons are as follows;
- Those are battle tested libraries
- They are covered in tests
- They are small in line count
- The next few projects I will be in charge of will also be small enough that these tools would likely be sufficient amount of tooling.

Then, once I get comfortable playing these cover songs. I could look to the JS community for some of the better plugins which do not have tests and do my best to apply tests to them. Or, perhaps write my own.

## Still in school.

Sometimes I forget that my education is far from finished. The tech scene wants so bad to think it’s advanced beyond these fundamentals but the reality is the web development stack of HTML/JS-Q/CSS housed on Rails app is not going anywhere. It’s a safe bet to keep focusing on these technologies. There is no FOMO because nobody has done what Rails has done, yet.
