# Variables

I can still remember the time when learning to code that I didn't yet see the point of variables. Not in the `x + 1 = 3`, what is x kind of way. But that `car = Car.new`. 

Variables do not simply hold value, they hold reference to unknown entities. They are agnostic. They are a way to create boundaries between objects. Boundaries create structure, even design.

Variables become first class citizens when you want to have freedom to interchange concepts of your design in a few places as possible. Variables create boundaries between objects who need the job but don't care who does the job.

## Value of variables
- hold value
- create boundaries
- capable of simplifying complexity
- impartial to DNA
- placeholders
