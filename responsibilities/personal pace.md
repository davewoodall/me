# personal pace
As a developer you need to discover your optimal daily productivity. Ideally, you can achieve that in in your work. That is what I consider a good cultural fit. 

I'm working on a bug that is completely unfamiliar to me. Yet, there seems to be no one else who is willing to look at it. Sure, I could fret over it or I could dive in. My personal pace is to use it as an opportunity to learn the larger knowledge domain until the bug becomes an easy fix.

So, I have the bug as my guiding light but I am not going to force the knowledge. I'm going to enjoy the ride. For me that means reading wide and deep until I gain enough context to be a at least competent on the subject at hand.
