About CatMathDo 

_17 Apr 2013_

Hey I’m Dave,
I have two boys and do what I can to help prepare them for life. After we established the ability to count to 10, I began to wonder if they knew what the difference was between the numbers.

My next task in teaching them way the idea of ‘value’ and ‘movement’

So, I started doing different exercises. I started by;
1. Teaching the sentence that ‘math is how numbers play together’
2. Math playground
3. which cat is bigger, the 1 year old or the 5 year old cat?
4. then, I started saying ‘plus goes up’ and ‘minus goes down’

One day it kind of clicked that I could turn this into a board game. Since I’m a designer & developer, I decided to make a game and website.

Turns out Oscar loves CatMathDo and we play it more often than connect four, go fish, or other toddler games.

I don’t know what else to do with the game right now, so I’m just giving the PDF away for free. Take it to kinkos. Also, you can buy bingo chips from this supplier;

I’d love to know what your experience is playing with CatMathDo. It would mean a lot if you post something on my Facebook page, or mention me in a tweet :-)

Thanks!

Dave
