Intro

There are many different reasons people become developers. That means that many people come from different backgrounds. Some of those backgrounds are very specific and as such, those individuals have a very deep and specific skill set. Others, have a broad range of skills. 
  
Being a professional developer means you need to know a lot about a lot. Since your software runs on a computer, you need to know a little bit about your computer. Since you want to be paid for writing code, then you need to know how business works. Since your software is for other people, you need to be able to get along with other people, even those who bother you. 

I'm a big picture kind of person. For the longest time I resisted writing code. I had formed several bad stereotypes of what being a programmer meant. One of my personal attributes is I crave context. I need to know the big picture and I try to start from the big picture. I think that's why I Rails has been such a great entry point. It was the highest level for me to actually join in and get my first job 5 months after I completed a bootcamp. (Don't let the 5 month figure impress you. I spent only 3 months there before being laid off. 

My point is I'm starting to find some people and talks who are helping describe the details now that I've been here a while. This is my attempt at understanding what it means to be full stack developer;


- hardware
- software
- people skills
- business skills
- tools
- habits
