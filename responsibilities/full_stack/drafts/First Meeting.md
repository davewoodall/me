# First Meeting

Trying to get my bearings how these things fit together. As a Rails developer, I entered into software development at the top floor. I knew there were many layers below but how and where they connect is a mystery

## Electrical signals
Electrical signals are the voltage changes on the wire.


Voltage changes on the wire that means something. As electrical current moves down a wire, how do you use electrical signal to transfer data. 

When you see the cables, circuit board, chips, silver parts (traces). Down there, what's happening in that metal is the value of the voltage is constantly fluctuating and the patterns of those fluctuations are how we describe data that that level.

3vDC -3vDC

## Binary

Move up a level, the next thing is Binary. The 1's and 0's. 

Manchester Encoding
How do we look at patterns in the voltage changes and say this pattern means something ('foo' or 'bar'). 

Manchester encoding is a way to have a DC signal tell you something. The Voltage is constant. The voltage doesn't change - that's 0. When the voltage changes, that's a 1. 

The encoding scheme is how you you use the electrical signal to get binary on the wire. Binary 1's and 0's are the encoding


## Assembly
Two most common instruction sets are x86_64 ARM

What that is chip manufacturers like Intel or AMD or ARM take binary sequences of 1s and 0s in certain groups and certain sequences and assign them to instructions such as `push`, `pop`, `jump`, `compare`

    ### Push, pop, jump?
    What are these?


At the assembly level we're still bound to the hardware. You can program in x86_64 and ARM but those instruction sets are physically burned into the chips. You can't change them unless you buy new hardware.

x86_64 is INTEL
ARM is probably what's in your phone.


## Compilers
Build a C executable that match the target.

## Package managers
npm, homebrew, rubygems, apt, yum
            
            
## Interpreters
High level languages use interpreters.
