# Electrical signals
Electrical signals are the voltage changes on the wire.

Voltage changes on the wire that means something. As electrical current moves down a wire, how do you use electrical signal to transfer data. 

When you see the cables, circuit board, chips, silver parts (traces). Down there, what's happening in that metal is the value of the voltage is constantly fluctuating and the patterns of those fluctuations are how we describe data that that level.
