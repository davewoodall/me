# tradeoffs in langauges
As you go from bottom to top, you are trading expression and flexibility for performance and productivity.

# universal languages
all languages have their pros and cons. The closet to universal languages are possibly C and Javascript. Node & JS. But at the bottom of Node is V8's and raw hardware. That's about as close as we're going to get. 

# js is functional or oo?
Defined named functions and pass them around.

# picking the tools
A lot of time a major engineering consideration is picking tools. What do we already know? You want to learn new things but when you need to get a thing done - when you're on a deadline, picking what you know and if it can do the job (as in good fit for the job) 

## R&D vs. Shipping
How much R&D can you afford? It is almost always beneficial to do some R&D before choosing the solution. Thinking through how to solve the problem with architechure and tools. The market is competitive so you have to ship. But taking a few moments to make sure the right tool and path for the job. Out of the tools our team is familiar with, are any of them a good fit for the problem?  if not, then maybe we need to investigate new technologies. 

# node
in theory you have one language so you don't need front end and backend developers. you just need more than one developer.

# speed is not always the most important thing
when you spin up services so fast and forget to consider engineering rigor - you wind up with gnarly performance problems, code becomes unmaintainable, it can be a nightmare

But, those are the problems most businesses say "we won't have those problems for a couple of years and our primary problem is to get to market and to be profitable / solvent". 

So, they work hard with crappy code to get customers. Then they say, now we need to scale it up. Now performance is a problem which we wouldn't have had if we didn't sell something.
