# Assembly
Two most common instruction sets are x86_64 ARM

What that is chip manufacturers like Intel or AMD or ARM take binary sequences of 1s and 0s in certain groups and certain sequences and assign them to instructions such as `push`, `pop`, `jump`, `compare`

    ### Push, pop, jump?
    What are these?


At the assembly level we're still bound to the hardware. You can program in x86_64 and ARM but those instruction sets are physically burned into the chips. You can't change them unless you buy new hardware.

x86_64 is INTEL
ARM is probably what's in your phone.
