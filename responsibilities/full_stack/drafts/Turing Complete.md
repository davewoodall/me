## Turing Complete
Once you have a language that is Turing Complete, you can build anything in it. You can build applications in C, C++, and Rust. But the reason that languages like Ruby and Python exist are for tradeoffs. 

Languages main features are abstractions. And the reason abstractions are useful is they are supposed to make problems easier to reason about. And they are supposed to make it more expressive and easier to communicate. By making it easier to communicate, it raises developer productivity to get more done with it. And that's worth it. Because People time is usually way more expensive than hardware time.
