# The Full Stack

I'm one of the people who began coding by attending a code school in Chicago, in 2012. Somewhere along the way it was conveyed that Rails developers are Full Stack developers. That sounded pretty cool to me. But come to find out many people began to explain that to be an inaccurate description. I knew I wasn't there yet so I decided to keep the sizzle but be a little real about it, simply describing myself as an _aspiring full stack developer._

I've been working full time full time as a professional developer since 2014. It took me two years before I knew enough to be employed for longer than 90 day contracts. I met Chris as my current Employer and from the first time I heard him talk, I could tell that he knew the full stack. So we started meeting weekly and he was kind enough to mentor me. The following notes are from our sessions.

## False floor.

Chris's role at the company was more of a low-level generalist. He explained to me that he was neither dev ops or a developer. But I thought since he wasn't writing Rails-related code that his DevOps experience would help me understand our team as a whole. At the time Chris was working on something loosely related to Docker so I figured that was the ground floor. As we were chatting about why I'd like to meet and what I want to know, I asked him how well he knew the file system of our Apple Laptops. I explained that I didn't know much about the underlying file structure and I would be interested in learning about the structure of my local machine and then we build up from there to what docker and friends do as a service. Chris sent introduced me to the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard). He explained that those files are best practice but this is loosely it. After reading over that wikipage I asked Chris how well he knew that file system and how much of that surface area he knew "All of it." was his reply. I was glad to hear that. I proceeded to make a chart based on my mental model at the time;

[FHS]

It was all I knew and I figured we were at the ground floor. When Chris saw this, he said "Oh I see what you're trying to do. Let's look at it differently. Let's start below FHS. Let's start at the electricity." :boom: As I came to discover, Chris has worked in every relevant level of computer programming from volts to binary to assembly to compilers to C to Interpeters to Ruby. These are my notes as I learn the pathway.

This is an attempt to go from electrical volts to Rails in one stack. There are many different stacks and this book does not propose to explain them all. This is the stack that I currently live in so it's the only one I can speak to.
