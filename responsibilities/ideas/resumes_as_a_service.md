Resumes as a Service

I was working on my resume and realizing i donâ€™t want to post it for spammers


	platform that charges recruiters (google ad words style) to view your resume

you post your resume and you say how much it costs to;
- view your profile ($.05 click)
- contact you ($.25 click)
- view their listing ($.50 click)

Platform takes a cut.

they can contact me as long as they pay
helps filter out meaningless noise
maybe raise the prices, i dunno.
