I've come to the personal realization that it is best to separate data and distribution. This repo used to contain both. I had high hopes this would be a collection of webpages that I build with content. Yet, for whatever reasons, I found the consolidation to be confusing. As such, I'm going through the process of reinvention. I'm glad to have experienced this first hand. Lesson learned.
