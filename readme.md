# Wheel Reinvention in progress

Hello, fellow developer.

This is where I practice progressive enhancement. If you are not also already doing so, then I cannot recommend [Adaptive Web Design]() enough. If you are not familiar with the term, it is a fancy way of saying that the content comes first. That means no more lorem ipsum, foo, or bars. It means reading the content, then letting it influence the markup. Markup influences style. And as such, I need content to practice. The content I'm using varies so that I can enhance accordingly. My languages include; HTML, Markdown, tweets, poems, css, ruby, js and more.

The need it meets for me is managing my big data. (\_dw TODO write about my big data and add link here). From the url's perspective, this probably looks like another blog. From the code perspective, it looks like a junk drawer. I'm sure it's both and then some.
