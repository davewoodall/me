# Study

A way to manage links related to different topics.

/study/backbone
/study/http

I want a way to focus on a big topic with all resources in front of me and make a case about it.

## importObject
- import file of links (group of links)

## linkObject
- links get converted into linkObjects

## studyObject
- linkObjects get associated to studyObjects
- overview of comments
- list of comments made 

## application
- based on their study i make a few things;
  -- updates about the linkObject I just read
  -- overview commetentary on studyObject

- I'm able to relate one topic to another
- link to some outputs (most likely my own blog post or project) as proof.
