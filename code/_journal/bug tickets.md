bug tickets
they cause the most of many things;
- anxiety
becuase they catch you off gurad there is a sense of complete ignorance and urgency. 

- understanding
they test my understanding of the code base. As such, either I will be able to accomplish the bug quickly, and pain free

- knowledge
or, I will learn something new and expand my understanding as a developer. Many times the bug will bring up topics you were loosely familiar with by not knowledgable on.

It's a valiant effort to want to write the pefect code and know all the things. However, the reason there is a massive need for developer talent is there is a never ending amount of things to learn and know. The best you can do is find your own personal pace of growth and development.
