# Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
An attack where the user's active session is used against them which often goes undetected by the server or user. The best defense is to implement anti-CSRF tokens on sensitive operatoins within the website such as sensitive forms or transactions. Although not as transparent, asking a user to re-auth on sensitive data is another form of defense.

Attackers are able to get a user to perform an action without knowing it. To the server, everything looks as if the user wanted to do it.
