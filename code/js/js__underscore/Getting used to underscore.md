Getting used to underscore

Iâ€™m starting to get the gist that the pattern of using underscore is; 

`_.underscore(data, businessLogic(), environmental)`

There is a function you use to munge data someway in conjunction with our business logic. Then, if there is something related to context, this, or a switch of some kind - that is managed as well.
