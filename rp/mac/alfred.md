# alfred

I've had alfred a few years now but never got into it. I confess it's probably because I didn't have the mental space or workflow needs for effency. But now I get it and this looks like it can change everything.

My tasks are focused on very specific, regular things. Like checking slack for work. But I don't want slack to check me. I don't want it to alert me and I don't want to see it to remind me about it. I want a completely clean work space.
