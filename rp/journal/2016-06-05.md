## Postgres backups

Today I learned how to backup my database on heroku. I’ve wanted to know how to do this for at least a year or two. Since Databases hold the data, it is vital to ensure that is not lost. It’s pretty hard to believe that a database will be a growing entity that I will need to take care of for years. It is something that needs to be learned with real data. My own writings are the least valuable data which I still want to protect. Better to learn on my content than on the customers!

This is one of those lessons that shows up from working on a side project. I can’t say that I’ve read a book yet that instructed me to do this. 


## Testing thoughts

I’m trying to figure out how best to test now that System tests are part of my workflow. I pinged Chris Kottom to get his thoughts.

	Chris,
	I’m struggling a bit to see what is necessary test coverage vs. redundant for a small project. Can a new app suffice with Unit and System tests? Or do Controller, Policy, and Request tests still hold a unique value.
