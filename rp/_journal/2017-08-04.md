# Getting organized.

This week I was able to spend some time cleaning up my notes. I started a new format by creating folders for all the topics I feel like are part of my responsibilities. So far, I like that I have space to write out thoughts, todos, and other misc. things in a file that is at minimum organized by something I've identified as important. At first, I had contained all these `/rp` topics into a `/topics` directory, but I quickly realized that I want to keep my responsibilities front and center.

# Genesis commentary

I also started a multi-headed project. My commentary on genesis. I want to be able to write in markdown, locally, and then have it post, statically. I narrowed in on hosting it here in my notes. I'm excited that I also gives me a chance to practice my other growing skills of TDD (using Jasmine) and Backbone.

I'm not learning backbone as a modern tool. Rather, because it is small, simple, and there is tons of documentation about it. Since there is no more active development, most every question I have has been answered already.

# Ugly baby code.

I also came to the realization that I'm going to start writing code that I love but is most likely ugly to other people. But that's okay. The reason why it's ugly is because it's code I'm writing by myself and nobody cares anyway - other than that it works! More on this later.
