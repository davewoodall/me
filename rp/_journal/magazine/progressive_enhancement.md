# Progressive Enhancement

When I first heard this word progressive enhancement I thought it was something of a charitable deed for the old ladies who were still using IE6. That websites should work without javascript for those computers behind security firewalls and such. I didn’t see why we were waisting our time.

Then I went to An Event Apart. It was of the best conferences I’ve attended. 19 out of 20 of the speakers were 10/10. The first was Jeffrey Zeldmen and it was really cool to hear him in person speak of his passions. He recommended a book over his own, which is quite a big thing for an author to do. It made me respect Jeffrey all the more! The book he recommended was Adaptive Web Design. Even though the 1st edition is [free online]() I bought the 2nd edition. 

The book has really made an impression on me. It has helped motivate me to start writing again in an indirect way. I’m only 4 chapters in but I wanted to stop and write. 

I will record more specifics later, but the premissis is that Content drives design. as such, I realized that I just need to write content in order to practice my professional skills. Of course, I could simply design around lorem ipsum, but the point is that the copy, the actual words should influence how a page is laid out and styled. That really struck me. As such, it’s made me want to start blogging, writing, codeing, thinking about  html, and even my workflow.
