# rabbit holes

The last two days I’m getting some clarity on what the flow of development really looks like. This is my attempt to describe it so that I can better understand it myself as someone who wants to levelup. 
  
## The Ocean’s four walls
When I started to code I thought it would be similar to learning Accounting. That there are fundamental concepts that are applied and things are simply putting things in tiny little boxes and following a similar format. Fortunately, I figured out that context but it turned out to be different than i thought it would look like. 

## Pocket Watch
To write software you must know about the moving parts. At first, I thought the pocket watch was a good way to guide my learning. At some level it was in that there are a lot of moving parts to make a web app. But where the analogy tripped me up is I unintentionally kept thinking that once I took these pieces apart, all web apps put these pieces together in a same way. That is not the case. 

## Boxing the ocean
It occured to me that I was trying to find the four walls of the ocean. Once I realized that web development is a symphony of endless options to apply the components, I began to see that all web apps have similar fundamentals, but infinite approaches to those things. 
Once I saw the futility of trying to wrap my mind around the edge of the ocean, I begain to shift my perspective again as to what being a web developer really looks like. 

## Go with the flow
All web development needs a purpose. A focus or a goal. Without it is like sitting in a boat without a motor, sails, or rudder. Sure you get some sense of how it works, but you really need a destination. That destination can be watching a video tutorial, reading a book, or coding along with a new side project. The point is your mind is aware that there is a destination. 


## Destination is the ticket
Any software shop will have it’s own way of providing that direction. Usually it’s with a ticket, task, or something similar. That ticket is where you want to go.

## The long and winding road
There are times when the ticket is straight forward and a simple fix. Those are not really worth writing about. I’m interested in understanding how the hard problems get solved. 

I’ve started to realize that my ticket will be a miniture adventure through various ideas and places that were not identified in the ticket. Things that are blocking my ability to get the ticket done. 

## Breadcrumbs example.

I’ve got a toy app that I use to learn. I call it a Fake Farm. I got the idea of managing a toy app from [dave hoover], who was one of my mentors at code academy. I’m working with Pundit at work and so I thought about applying it to Fake Farm so that I could poke around in a safe place. I created a new branch titled  *Add-Pundit*. That was my task. 

So watch this rabbit hole I fell down. First I’ll do the high level just to keep it clear for my own sake;

1. - Pundit, to
2. - Users, to
3. - Devise, to
4. - Clearance, to
5. - Roll my own, to
6. - Rails Tutorial, to
7. - Writing Rails 5.1 system tests, to
8. - Writing some Capybara, to
9. - Realizing I don’t know enough Capybara, to
10. - Writing out these notes!

Wow.. Look at that. All of these things are great but this is why things take more time than expected. It’s a combination of what is needed to be done, combined with unanswered questions, combined with my own inexperiences. This is the life of a web developer. 

It is very clarifying for me to see how easy it is to fall into a trap like this. The term _Mental model_ means that you have clarity of the space you are working in. It is not possible to keep a mental model when you stuff it with 10 things. Just like pulling a string and unwinding a sweater, going down a path like this really has the ability to unwind mental motivation and create some mental fatigue.

I think this is why Kent Beck and friends talk about having a note pad right next to your desk and write down goals and blockers. 

## New idea

I’m going to proactively keep a piece of paper each day to record what I’m doing and how they are connected. I’m not sure yet if it’s a mind map or something simlar. But all I know is this is a big insight for me to learn how to control my thoughts in a way that I can be more productive, less anxious, and mentally organized.
