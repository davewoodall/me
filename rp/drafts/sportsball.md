*sportsball, the only topic we don’t discuss*

Which, would effectively be known in conversation as a podcast called ‘sportsball,' and here’s how the conversation goes until we’re famous...

> 1: I listen to sportsball
> 2: yeah what’s your favorite team?
> 1: oh, it’s actually called *sportsball, the only topic we don’t discuss*
> 2: what do you mean?
> 1: gtfo

_Re: topics / content_
I propose we meet once a week during a 'lunch time' for an hour over a recorded zoom. 

We use the 1st 15m to come up with the agenda for the remaining three, 15m sections. Then talk on point for 15m per topic. 

So we have 1st 15 to decide, what we talk about next(x3). I’ll play the role of scrum master :bill:




our t-shirts will just be

`!` :football:
 
and.. that’s how we’ll :troll: our own. Getting all the nerds wearing sports t-shirts in the end.

it’s just :troll: everywhere
