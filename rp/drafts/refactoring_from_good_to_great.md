I met Ben at RockyMtnRuby when he gave this talk. We played foosball and got our butts kicked by the Pivotal guys. It was in their office, so what do you expect. I also appreciate that he's wearing a t-shirt I made when I ran AMB3R.

But what I enjoy the most is watching Ben refactor this code. I've been slowly learning the things he's teaching so it was great to see him put them all together. I'm in the middle of reading [GOOS]() and have Refactoring on my very short list of books to read next.

TODO - put some notes here.
