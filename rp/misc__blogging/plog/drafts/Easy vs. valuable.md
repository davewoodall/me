## Easy vs. valuable

Would you rather spend your time doing things that are easy or valuable? I recognize it depends on the situation. Easy often wins because it’s, well easy. But what happens when the easy thing becomes difficult? Now, you’re left with neither ease or value. Posting a tweet or a blog post is easy if your content is not valuable. But data is valuable. It’s the photos of your childhood. Or the thoughts you had when you were learning something new. 

As an aspiring author, I need to read more than I write. I need to edit, think, and build on thoughts I’ve written before. It’s easy to just sit here and type out on IA writer, in dark mode, with a cup of coffee at 4:11am. What’s hard is facing the work part. Clarifying the goal and working toward it.
