# cleaning out my backpack

I’ve been using backpackit since 2007. 10 years! I was paying $7 a month. Backpack is by far, the best personal organizer I used. I feel like I tried lots to see if there was something better. But none worked as well. Kudos to Jason Fried and DHH! 

This past week I pulled my content off the platform and downgraded to the free plan. This is a personal big deal. Changing a 10 year habit of any kind is a big deal. 

This change is part of my consolidation of data and wanting to use my professional skills on my own data. I moved the content into my notes so that I can edit, post, or delete my content accordingly. It feels good to move toward consolidation.

I still have one outstanding spot to organize - my dropbox. It feels like it will be a big task because I’m at 500gb so I’m not going to try to do that in one sitting. I know that will take time but I can already feel the mental margin of a clean workspace.

Part of consolidating is deleting unused content. Getting it out of the way so I can focus. I am focused on focusing. Another area I cleaned up this week was my `Code/` directory which housed repos since 2012. I deleted all that I’m not actively working on. I’m narrowing in on 5 repos;

- FakeFarmApp for Rails related spikes
- Fake Farm Static for front end related spikes
- .me for notes and as my new backpack
- .com for work and resume
- Leavelist as my toy app

LeaveList is my attempt to build my own version of backpack. I have no idea how far I will get but after using that site for 10 years, I have a good idea of what I want leaveList to do similarly and different.
