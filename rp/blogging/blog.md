# blog

I’m beginning to think I’ve reached the level of my static note taking where I would benefit from a server. I have yet to find a satisfactory way to eliminate code duplication. 

So here is a list of things I want to do with my blog:

## Database
- run on postgres
I need to be comfortable with backing up and loading data 

## Hosting
- $7 heroku hobby
I am okay

## Features
- time tracking
- todos
- standup
- notes
- link mgmt
- shared partials!
- users
- fakefarming
