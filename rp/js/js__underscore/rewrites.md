rewrites


## Theory
I have a theory that I will become a better coder if I simply copy code from mentors. By having their tests, I can be assured that their code works as advertised. I just need to copy it and also the implementation. In theory, I will build these popular projects and will learn how they work, how they are built, and how to code.

The repo is live and so I can also submit a question in an issue, which they could respond to if I get really stick.

Ruby Toolbox is endless supply of code options!
