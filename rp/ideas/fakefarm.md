hey hey! i’ve been slammed at work but i’m keeping tabs via email. Congrats on launching the new _jr.heroku as service_!

[4:50]
you excited about 5.1 yarn/webpack additions?!

[4:50]
going to be sweet…
I’m wondering if they’re going to keep support for Engines.

[4:50]
have you done any work / thoughts about those?

[4:51]
_no rush on any of this.. _ :wave:

excid3 [4:54 PM]
Thanks man! It had been a ton of work but it is so fun to use it to deploy my own apps, so it feels worth the effort. :wink: The web pack stuff works really nicely. You can use it on rails 5.0 too. Even tried it with hatch and setup all new servers to be yarn compatible by default which is dope.

wwwoodall [4:55 PM]
do you work with any good contractor / frontend people?

[4:56]
this is not a recruiter! haha

excid3 [4:56 PM]
I can't imagine rails engines are going anywhere btw

wwwoodall [4:56 PM]

wwwoodall [4:58 PM]
reading https://adaptivewebdesign.info/ from it.
Adaptive Web Design
Adaptive Web Design: Crafting Rich Experiences with Progressive Enhancement
Building an elegant, functional website requires more than just knowing how to code. In Adaptive Web Design, Second Edition, you’ll learn how to use progressive enhancement to build websites that won’t break, work anywhere, are accessible by anyone—on any device, and are designed to work well into the future.

[4:58]
oh nice!

[4:58]
How can I meet him? just DM here?

excid3 [4:58 PM]
I don't think I've seen this adaptive site before

[4:58]
Yeah you can dm him

[4:59]
Might ask around and see who else is a designer in general or on the forum

wwwoodall [4:59 PM]
I say it’s required reading for ANY frontend person. introduces progressive enhancement which is what the JS world needs to understand

excid3 [4:59 PM]
I think there are several

wwwoodall [4:59 PM]
great to hear

[4:59]
yeah, i don’t have anything pressing. just curious. i love you/guyzeszz work!

excid3 [4:59 PM]
Oh cool, I'm so tired of these loading images as if that is acceptable for the UI

wwwoodall [4:59 PM]
jeffrey zeldman recommended that book so i finally bought it

excid3 [5:00 PM]
You ever used web flow?

[5:00]

[5:01]

wwwoodall [5:07 PM]
i’ve got a business model idea. want me to share? I only say that b/c i don’t want to type it out if you’re busy. haha

excid3 [5:08 PM]
Let's hear it

[5:09]
I've been thinking a lot about business model stuff lately. GoRails needs a better one.

wwwoodall [5:09 PM]
yeah man. you’re headed for a :runner:  :train2: … but i know you know that better than i do!

[5:10]
okay some common terms so i can translate `code` to :moneybag: :moneybag:

[5:10]
Rails Engine `==` Kit

[5:10]
Hourly Rate ($N) `==` Glue

[5:11]
Private Repo / Dig.Ocean `==` Barn

[5:13]
------
SAAS AS A SAAS

[5:13]
SAASASASAAS

[5:13]
Did it in one stroke!

excid3 [5:13 PM]
Hahaha

wwwoodall [5:13 PM]
*Kits*

[5:14]
- devise || AUTH KIT ($400, + $3m hosting in our Barn)
- stripe || CC KIT ($1,200, + $9m hosting in our Barn)
- _etc etc_ (edited)

[5:14]
+ $GLUE Costs

excid3 [5:14 PM]
Yeah I've been thinking about this

[5:14]
Have you seen Laravel spark?

[5:14]
It is a $100 template that comes with a ton of stuff

[5:15]
We should have paid templates in rails too

[5:15]
Also...

[5:15]
Did you see that Mike perham had made $1.8M from sidekq???

wwwoodall [5:16 PM]
Custom responsive template can be a “UI KIT for $300” like Shipify

[5:16]
no way from his consulting?

[5:16]
that’s awesome

excid3 [5:16 PM]
No just support licenses

[5:16]
I think

[5:17]
He made over $800k in 2016

[5:17]
Which is nuts

[5:17]
I wish I was doing that

[5:17]
But when you sell to businesses you win

[5:17]
My problem is selling to consumers

wwwoodall [5:17 PM]
yeah i learned that in the t-shirt business :smile:

[5:17]
exactly!

[5:18]
i’m still in love with 37signals

excid3 [5:18 PM]
T-shirts have to be crazy competitive

[5:18]
Me too

[5:18]
That's my goal

wwwoodall [5:18 PM]
confession - i only stopped paying for backpackit.com last month. Been paying $7 for 10 years!

excid3 [5:18 PM]
Something as loved and profitable as that

[5:18]
That's awesome

[5:18]
Wow

wwwoodall [5:18 PM]
i literally used that AND highrise today

excid3 [5:19 PM]
You should email Jason fried about that

wwwoodall [5:19 PM]
ha true. i actually tweeted him about buying backpack off him and he said ‘put an offer together’

excid3 [5:19 PM]
High-rise is great too. Have you been watching Nathans vlogs about it?

[5:19]
Oh wow

wwwoodall [5:19 PM]
no. great dude tho!

[5:20]
i’ve been nose down in code since i sold my t-shirt business in 2012.

excid3 [5:20 PM]
That would be cool. If I could pick to work with anyone it would be those guys

wwwoodall [5:20 PM]
same

[5:20]
i think there’s still ways with rails toolset simply as a platform to manage other saas’asses

[5:21]
it would be the perfect blend of freelance + reoccuring revenue as the long term goal

[5:21]
which is hard to come by

excid3 [5:21 PM]
Yeah that is super hard to get

wwwoodall [5:22 PM]
that’s my working goal with www.fakefarm.com

excid3 [5:22 PM]
But agreed

wwwoodall [5:22 PM]
i’m deep in corporate code and it, is… :monkey_face: :shit:

[5:23]
i need to come back to small b2b stuff

excid3 [5:23 PM]
Ugh that's the worst. I never want to go back to that life. (edited)

wwwoodall [5:23 PM]
haha

[5:23]
good talking with you man. Feel free to ping me anytime

[5:23]
dinner time!

new messages
excid3 [5:24 PM]
Alright man! We should chat more about this stuff soon. There's some really good ideas here..
And I'm in dire need of something different so hatch is one of those first strides to that

wwwoodall [5:27 PM]
for sure. things like snap chat have millions of customers who just learned their favorite social site just sold for :moneybag: so they are all thinking about how to start their own startup. it’s got to be cheap to start and effective for their small business idea. it would be fun as a lifestyle business to tinker with the best open source gems and build a platform offering the stuff that is FREEEEEE to us to use to service their bike shop or fish tour or sewing class or `schedule engine` or `gem pundit` or or or :sunglasses: (edited)
