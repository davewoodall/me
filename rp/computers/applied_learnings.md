# applied learnings

There's a difference between learning and applying knowledge. I think I love to learn because of what knowledge enables. Knowledge is power because life is full of death. Learning is hard and time consuming but the advantage is if you apply your efforts to learning something valuable then it can change your life. 

HTML is a skill that is entangled to seemingly countless other concepts. But after about 10 years you can eventually apply your knowledge to saying something. Meta tags, classes, elements, and more. All of it takes time to learn.
