Secure Sign-Up/In/Out (Email from Rhagu)
========================================

1) Make a new app.
First let's allow users to sign up securely.

2) Make a user resource.
If you still need practice with The Golden Seven, do it by hand;
otherwise you can use shortcuts.

Be sure to include a column to uniquely identify each user (using
email is standard) and a column to store the encrypted password
(bcrypt requires that it be called `password_digest'), along with any
other columns you want.

3) Activate the bcrypt gem.
After you change the Gemfile, don't forget to...?

4) In the new user form, make the necessary changes that bcrypt needs
to work.
What fields does a user need to fill out to securely sign up?

5) Make the necessary changes in the user model file. Here are three
things to do;
a) make users have a secure password, (run a migration to add
`password_digest' to model)
b) make it so that we can mass assign the attributes that bcrypt needs
to work,
(don't add `password_digest', but add `password', and
`password_confirmation')
c) make sure you can't have two accounts with the same email address.
(add validates_uniqueness_of :email)

Users can now sign up securely!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, let's allow them to sign in and out securely.

1) Make a sessions controller with three methods: new, create,
destroy.

2) Make routes which trigger those three methods.
Create should be POST; the others should be GET.

3) Make the sessions#new method display a form for email and password.
The form should post to the sessions#create method.

4) Make the sessions#create method check the provided email/password
combo. If correct, it should log them in and redirect to the user's
show page. If incorrect, it should render new again.

5) Make the destroy method clear out the cookie.
It should redirect to the users index page.

6) Show signin/signup links at the top of every page if there's no
user signed in, or a signout link if there is.

P.S. Here's Rhagu's solution. Please don't look at it until you've
struggled with it yourself, collaborated with classmates, and are
completely stuck.
