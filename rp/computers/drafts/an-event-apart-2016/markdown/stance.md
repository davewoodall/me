# stance

- bootstrap is a prototype tool. Once you have it write then it's time to code by hand. Bootstrap is bloated and slows down the users experience

- code for yourself

- test for yourself

- make the sites that are able to transcend the browser and device and screen size

- if you find yourself ready to compromise and do the easy thing in your work then think of it as if you're doing it for a family member like your ageing father. not some random person.

- your brand happens between devices

- love the craft not the paycheck

- do your job for them. but do it your way. so make sure you have a way of doing things or you will not like this craft. If your craft does not have something the job doesn't want to do it because it's not profitable then you don't know your craft well enough. Do not code for money. Code because you love what you do. life is not about money. Get good at what you do and do the right thing - as pros do. Also, pros doing the right thing do so without adding bugs.

- when you write markup do all you can to avoid thinking in terms of style. Think more in terms of sterile. The markup you write should describe it's purposeful use rather than it's specific content. for example you may want content to look like a paragraph but if the use is of greater importance make it an `h2`

- base interaction around user first
