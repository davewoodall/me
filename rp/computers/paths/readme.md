# Paths

There is so much to learn that it easy to become overwhelmed. I'm going to try something new to keep my focus. I've decided to pick a topic that I want to focus on each day. That way I have some variety and ability to focus. These topics are an ongoing learnings so they are broad. I also want to keep momentum so I'm going to try to keep notes about each of these.

Currently, I'm interested in leveling up in these 6 areas;

- Testing
- Ruby and Rails
- Databases
- Computer Science Subjects
- FrontEnd
- API's

I've arbitrarily assigned each subject to a specific day so that I can focus on that subject.
