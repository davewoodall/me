# Binary

Move up a level, the next thing is Binary. The 1's and 0's. 

Manchester Encoding
How do we look at patterns in the voltage changes and say this pattern means something ('foo' or 'bar'). 

Manchester encoding is a way to have a DC signal tell you something. The Voltage is constant. The voltage doesn't change - that's 0. When the voltage changes, that's a 1. 

The encoding scheme is how you you use the electrical signal to get binary on the wire. Binary 1's and 0's are the encoding
