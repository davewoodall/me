# Skipping lines

Taking a moment to reflect on this project after nearly 25 days of doing it. Wow.. can’t believe it’s really be that long!

The purist in me wants to say I copied every single line verbatim. Initially, I thought that was what I was going to do. But that was not the point of this project. The point was and is to learn. The aspects of the project that are not necessarily teaching me I give myself permission to skip. For example, specs that are simply aliases, or setup of null values. Anything I’ve already typed a few times for other specs, I am starting to skip over. I can do this because now I can grasp the concept by reading it, which is great! It’s a sign of progress that there is code that is easy to spot as boilerplate or contains concepts that I have grasped.
