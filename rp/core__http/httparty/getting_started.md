# getting started

Httparty is my second rewrite project. My first Ruby one. [here is the repo](https://github.com/wwwoodall/rewrite_httparty). I decided to rewrite this because of the following reasons;

- John Nunemaker is a professional and I know I will learn how to write better ruby code
- The gem is well tested!
- the gem is small enough to copy
- the subject matter of http is of interested and foundational

## current status

So far, my journey into setting httparty has been getting my environment setup properly. That primarily means configuring the gem, guard, and cucumber. I'm hitting an error when I run `be guard`

> Could not find 'bundler' (>= 0.a) among 51 total gem(s) (Gem::LoadError)

## mentality

I'm finding this kind of learning to be helpful because mentally I'm not focused on getting things to work but rather to be in the moment. To take it easy and figure out how to solve the issue at hand.

## pace

Also, since this is a learning project, I can just spend 30m or so at a time and then stop when I need to take a break. Like what I'm doing right now.
