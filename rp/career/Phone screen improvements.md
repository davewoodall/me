# Phone screen improvements

Phone screens need to be interesting for the reader / listener as much as the speaker. These questions suck.

## Ideal phone screen questions
- what do you hack on?
- do you code on the side?
- what is the biggest thing you built?
- what is the biggest team you've worked on?
- have you contributed to any open source?
- how well do you know OO and how did you learn it?
- what is your view of SOLID?
- who are your role models?
- what makes you a great addition to the team?
- what makes you unique?
