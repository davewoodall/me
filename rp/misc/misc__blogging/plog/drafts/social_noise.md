I’ve been so focused on learning to code that I didn’t realize the byproduct was mounds of data. Data is what we who live in the digital age produce. Data is such a boring word but it’s the  way to encompass the code, comments, photos, and tweets I’ve produced on facebook, myspace, twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Pintrest, Flikr, Everest, Codepen, github, Ello, App.net, assembly, bitbucket, youtube, dribbble, forrest, wordpress, linkedIn, medium, blogger, google, gmail, dropbox, backpack, and evernote. 

I use the terms Data and Content interchangeably. Here are some reasons why I’m so passionate about a seemingly boring idea; 

1. Content takes time to produce
Regardless of how you view content, It really depends on how you view content. To me, content requires time to produce. 

2. Content has a purpose
The more content I write, the more I want it to be a big, cohesive idea. I don’t wan to spend my content and waste it in a tweet. I want to craft it into an influencial idea. 

3. Good is the enemy of the best
I want to remove the tempations of just ranting in a place and moving on. 

4. social noise
As silly as it sounds, reading is not writing. Social media is a form of dull entertainment. You might go to a particual platform to write something but within seconds you are reading or distracted. Those platforms exist to sell advertising.

5. what do you want to do with your content?

Like all of us, I’ve been saving my content on whatever platform I had an account. It’s easy to post but it’s not easy to edit it, sort it, draft it, find it, or organize it. I want to return to my data because it helps me think. In trying to get a handle on my data I’ve found that is not an easy task.  


Data management takes time. It’s a chore and it’s tedious. My coding skills are beginning to reach a level where I can start to lean on them for personal tasks. This is a really exciting accomplishment. Rather than continue crafting content online, on other people’s platforms, I am bringing it local and use my professional skills and tools on myself. 

Unless you’re reading this on [github]() then you’re reading this post on my website. Right now, I’m sure it looks pretty basic but that’s because this is just the beginning. I’ve been working on the underlying structure to fit who I am and how I think.
