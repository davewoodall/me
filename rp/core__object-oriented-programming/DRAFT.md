# Testing

I had the pleasure of attending a course by [Sandi Metz](http://www.sandimetz.com/work-with-me). She recommended I read [Growing Object Oriented Softare Guided by tests](https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627), (GOOS for short). In the book they discuss the first assignment to get a skeleton test structure in place of Build/Deploy/Test. In my quest to build a skeleton structure I was lead to the idea of testing Routes. Routes are the glue to make sure a request hits the proper controller and action. So, I wonder if end to end testing begins with Routing specs. 

## Frameworks

There are two primary frameworks you need to be aware of in the Ruby community. **Minitest** and **RSpec**. They do the same thing in different ways. Minitest ships with Rails. It's not enough for Rails to use Minitest as-is, Rails adds some of it's own type of syntax which makes it look like a third test framework when it's simply some different syntax. RSpec is written as a Domain Specific Language(DSL) and wants to make testing flow like natural language.

## Types of tests

There are four layers of testing that I'm currently aware of. Integration, Functional, Unit, and Routing. 

To make sure we're saying the same thing when it comes to grammar; Routing tests, while small ensure things are connected. Unit tests test granular functionality. Functional tests ensure content is glued together. Integration tests go through and click the buttons and make sure things are as the user would view them.

## Testing languages

**Capybara** and **Cucumber** are two additional languages

## Testing environment

**WebDriver** and **Automated test running locally**. There are tools that will test your code before deploying to production

## Testing an API

Routing tests make sure url's get their proper controller and action

Three rails methods for testing routes (minitest)

```
assert_generates
assert_recognizes
assert_routing
```

from [routing from the outside in](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#inspecting-and-testing-routes)

## starting from scratch. 

## Gems installed

```
group :development, :test do
  gem 'capybara'
  gem 'poltergeist'
  gem 'rspec-rails'
  gem 'database_cleaner'
end
```

## Init Rspec

rails generate rspec:install

## What is Phantom.js?

> Phantom.js is a web browser

> It doesnâ€™t have a window like Opera or FireFox, it does all the work without ever displaying the pages. Why use it, then? Because it has an api that allows external programs to tell it what to do. This means that we can navigate the internet through Phantom.js, from our Ruby program Which gives us the full power of a real browser (which is mostly to say that we can run JavaScript the same way that we would in our web browser, whereas with Rack::Test, we were restricted to just HTML).
