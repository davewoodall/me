Make a skeleton
2/15/17

Not all my specs are passing, even when I drop in the source code into my specs. Which means I need to do some debugging regarding my spec translation. 

My current copy of underscore is just functions randomly placed. But I’m starting to think it would be beneficially to put the code in the exact position of `master` so that I can use diffs to help me spot typos and such. I’m going to create a `skeleton` copy of underscore and gut the functions to see if as I fill them in, how things are sewing together.

This is a great exercise to git and atom. I have customized atom a lot along the way.
