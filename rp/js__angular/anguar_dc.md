## my background
- I started a club b/c doug
- becuase everyone was talking about it
- bc i wanted to learn it
- bc there are other people who know it
- because i didn’t know what I didn’t know.

## why angular
- angular is fun to play with.
- browser is hostile
- more demand requires more powerful tools
- common language for teams and non-teams to talk together
- open source so there are other people asking questions - ie. SO
- doug said so

## benefits
- separates view logic
- it’s declarative
- has modules
- very maliable

## 2.0 fiasco
- they are rethinking that with peter bacon.
- we are still behind it
