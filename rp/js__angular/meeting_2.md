# Club meeting 2
Going through todomvc.com. Just copying it verbatim to get a sense of what an angular app ‘feels’ like. This is because Angular wants you to be declarative with your styles.

## Focus
typing out some angular to become comfortable with declarative programming

## Things to google
- ‘use strict’;


## Javascript methods to highlight
trim()

## LocalStorage
- using local storage.
- json parse.
- getting / setting local storage.
