# RFC 822

Notes from [rfc 822](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822)

## Overview 
This standard specifies a syntax for text messages that are sent  among computer users, within the framework of "electronic mail".

In this context, messages are viewed as having an envelope and contents. The envelope contains whatever information is needed to accomplish transmission and delivery. The contents compose the object to be delivered to the recipient. 

## Focus is the message format, not the 'envelope'
This standard applies only to the format and some of the semantics of message contents. It contains no specification of the information in the envelope.
