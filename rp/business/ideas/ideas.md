    hey jeremy, I'm sorry it has taken me since October to write you. It goes to the conversation we had about the most important thing on the web. (The /url). I've decided to focus on 3 main categories of life. etc.
    I also took to heart your 2nd comment that every blogger needs to figure out how to roll my own cms. I ended up starting my own and trying to be true to front end in order to force me to focus on the fundamentals. Progressive Enhancement, HTML, CSS, JavaScript - without the use of SQL, NODE, or a 2nd server. Just static pages.
    I've also decided to participate in >dereks /now</. I'm trying my own here, as a wall.

    show you >url-patterns<
    i went through these and when it came time to commit long term, i went with shorter. This has the advantage of being a little more personal.

    links of Jeremy's that I'm interested in;
    - his book about the web
    - clearleft
    - list apart articles
    - other media stuff
