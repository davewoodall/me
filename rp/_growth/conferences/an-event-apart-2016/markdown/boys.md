- stick to commitments. A commitment is not easy to keep. Learn what a commitment is and only make commitments for things you will stick with even when it is uncomfortable.

- change your mind. give yourself permission to change your mind. that means don't simply tell people and think you have to agree with it because it will make another person feel bad. At the end of the day there are more fools than friends and you want to be able to back out of foolish situations
