About 3 months ago Doug Ramsey mentioned we’re doing Angular. I had been interested in it enough to study it on my free time. So, I realized that the language is much more complex than the easy tutorials. There are some layers to working in a hostile environment of the browser.

I'd find something I wanted to do and align it with what the company needs. For example, I want to learn angular. Doug Rasmey said - 'We're going angular'. I took that as a signal that Angular is something we're willing some efforts in.

SO, I started Angular Code Club. And, it starts tomorrow! 

Here's the agenda but feel free to come and outcode us.

A book about adjusting to angular.

## Make a blog page about popular angular gem

## Preface
Taught for both beginner and expert javascript programmers.

if you are a beginner, you don’t need to unlearn things. It can give you some context when your experienced co-workers complain, but we do not need to unlearn imparrative, UJS, or jquery.

What we have to learn as beginners, is the larger environment that we are operating in. If you have this book, I’m going to assume you have put between 700 − 3,000 into learning to code. 

But even at that, there is still so much to learn. This book aspires to teach you what you need to know to have Angular running in a proper way. this goes broad and covered a lot of topics. At minimum, you will gain grammar to begin to articulate a question to get the future answers you seek. This might also be good for some of the experts who may never have taken the time to see a specific area.
