A programmers blog.

Plogging is more than blogging. It’s what programmers can and should do.  

Are you the kind of programmer who wants to blog but doesn’t? You have tried but find that you can’t keep at it. Sure you have all the platform hello worlds. Many are easy to get up and running. You’ve written the ‘this is my new blog post’ but then what? You are a coder and that’s what you like to do. Then, why do you feel the need to have a blog? I think it’s because we know they do have value. 

Web developers are some of the smartest people online. Yet, I see such little of their own original work. Sure, they use existing platforms but why don’t they build things for themselves? You can build whatever you want and say whatever you want!
