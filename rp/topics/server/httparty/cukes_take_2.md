# Cucumber

My informal survey of those who like cucumber tends to have it less liked than more so. It's like a 30/70 against. But, the people who I know that have used Cucumber are people I highly respect.

I was first introduced to it by [mike pack]() at my first job. However, I was too new to everything else so I didn't have the mental bandwidth like I do now.

So, I'm dipping my toe back into it with [rewriting httparty](https://github.com/wwwoodall/rewrite_httparty). The detractors typically say it's good for a product owner situation but I am beginning to wonder if it's useful for pioneer developers. Those who are doing something on the side. Is it possible that cukes are good for side-hustle type of projects? If so, then I'll like them. If not, then I'll soon discard.

TBD..
