# RSpec

RSpec is a test suite that is comprised of three separate gems which manage three different, important aspects of the whole. Those three gems are rspec-core, rspec-expectations, and rspec-mocks

I'm going to go through each of these in order to provide an centralized study of what each of these are.

# RSpec Core

- describe/it/context
- shared examples /context
- meta data
- described_class method
- subject
- let / let!
- before/after filters

# Rspec Expectations
- built in matchers
- shoulda

# Rspec-mock
- double()
- receive()
