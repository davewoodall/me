I am beginning to see that I was living in a false religion. The difference between my religion and Islam, is that at least Islam will be up front that they will disown you. The people I used to agree with don't realize that they are living in dark

What do you believe? Do you believe what you were taught or what you sought out? I used to believe what I was told. The tellers were a combination of sources: world, family, friends, school, church, government, media.

I couldn't see how I was any different than other people, faiths, yet I claimed that what I believed was the only way to heaven.

But now I see that what I was told was what the bible accurately describes as the darkness. The broad road. The house lived on sand.

It's amazing how many little lies I grew to accept. For example, I used to read the text in Joshua how the Sun stood still and in my ever so arrogance say 'the bible is actually wrong here because we all know the sun stands still already and the earth moves'. But now I believe the bible. The sun stood still. That would be hard to accomplish if the earth was moving.
