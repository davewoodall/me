The desert is a lonely place. Esspecially at night. There is a road that cuts straight through the middle of the wasteland. Nothing to see but a long black line. Driving through the desert is a battle of whits one faces with yourself.

In the middle of the desert is a roadside motel. There is a dusty billboard advertising for the motel about 100 miles before reaching it. If you are driving at night you might miss the bilboard because there are no lights on the sign. The sign simply says ‘motel with a pool’ 100 miles away. The thought of swimming in a pool in the middle of the desert is nothing short of heaven on earth.

There was a man who decided to drive during the night. He was scheduled to be at the city next to the twon the next day for a business meeting. So he drove through the night. The car he drove was a rental car. 

He saw the motel and pulled in. He needed some sleep. The motel was a U-shaped with 10 rooms that made. 

“are there any rooms?” he asked. The doorman let him in and as the man passed by “always” was the doormans response. The doorman wore a name tag “Luke”. “Thank you, luke” said the man. He walked to the front desk and waited for some service. He looked around the cramped lobby and nothing interesting stood out. The coffee table had the normal magazines. The T.V. news could have been made out to be about anything since the volume was absent. The man was instantly bored with the room. He turned back toward the desk and looked for a bell. Just then, a short, old lady walked out from the door behind the wall. 

The pool was open but nobody was in it.
