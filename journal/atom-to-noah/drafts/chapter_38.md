# Chapter 38

## Life behind the Laws.

I have a growing theory that YHVH allows the growth of mankind to go day by day. He will allow the development of laws and life to be built on experiences. I’ve been thinking about the origin of some of the laws. For example. 

#### Deuteronomy 25: 5 - 10

  5 “If brothers dwell together, and one of them dies and has no son, the wife of the dead man shall not be married outside the family to a stranger. Her husband’s brother shall go in to her and take her as his wife and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her.

  6 And the first son whom she bears shall succeed to the name of his dead brother, that his name may not be blotted out of Israel.

  7 And if the man does not wish to take his brother’s wife, then his brother’s wife shall go up to the gate to the elders and say, ‘My husband’s brother refuses to perpetuate his brother’s name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of a husband’s brother to me.’

  8 Then the elders of his city shall call him and speak to him, and if he persists, saying, ‘I do not wish to take her,’

  9 then his brother’s wife shall go up to him in the presence of the elders and pull his sandal off his foot and spit in his face. And she shall answer and say, ‘So shall it be done to the man who does not build up his brother’s house.’

  10 And the name of his house shall be called in Israel, ‘The house of him who had his sandal pulled off.’

This story of Tamar is in Genesis 38 is probably what led to the law related to brother’s who must continue the lineage with the dead brother’s wife. It’s possible also to show that the laws that are added to the 10 Commandments are due to the flaws of man. 

Is it possible that this connection, of a story behind the law is an example to show us that laws are established for a reason? That even though we have all the background stories, we can get the pattern and simply follow the laws we do know. 

After all, scripture even explains that we [see through a glass dimly](). Which means to me that even though we want to follow the law, there is still much uncertainty to the exact. It goes back to the heart. Does my heart desire all of God which is revealed. God knows that we cannot possibly know in our brief time.
