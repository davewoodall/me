# Verse 15

> An YHVH ELOHIYM took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to guard it. 

First time I’m reading an interpretation that uses “guard” instead of “keep”. Makes me wonder why Adam did not take his job  seriously. 

Also makes me wonder what “perfect life”, or sinless existence really means. Seeing that YHVH gives man choices, will choice really be taken from us in eternity? hmm..
