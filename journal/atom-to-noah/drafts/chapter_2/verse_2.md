verse_2
> And on the 7th day ELOHIYM ended His work which He had made. And He rested on the seventh day from all his work which He had made.

This is the completion of this creation. We know YHVH wasnâ€™t made on the 1st Day. The first day is simply a day He started something new. 

But then do we assume incorrectly that this is the first work of God which was completed? Which makes me wonder, does God always work 6 days and rest on the Seventh? Is this an eternal journey we are being exposed to with a physical earth, 24 hour days, and other moments of time. 

> For a day is as a thousand years and a thousand years is as a day

Is the book of Genesis preparing my heart for what will be similar patterns and lifestyle in eternity?
