Observations and thoughts from the first chapter of Genesis.

## 3 paths
genesis is a very opinionated world view. You cannot casually accept it, atheism, and lawlessness. Those are the 3 options; 
The biblical world view which explains how many false gods there are. The atheistic view that we came from a big fire cracker and a newt. Or the lawless world view, which is to say that there is no wrong answer, each person can make up their own view. 

## How many generations?
Genesis 2:4 is _really_ 1:1. It speaks of the generations of heavens and earth. Which makes me wonder if we’re actually living on the second generation of creation. Water is mentioned in verse two but it is not credited as being created on day 1. Yet, water is kind of a big deal.  

Chapter 2 circles back and tells more of what occurred on Day 6 with the creation of man and woman. I wonder if that’s what verse 1:2 is doing something similar and narrowing in on generation 2. 

## What is light
Light seems to have many meanings and even many origins. What is light and how can I walk in it?

## Who is ‘us’?
Verse 26 says “Let us make man”. I look forward to learning who that is

## Two great lights
I no longer blindly accept nasa or the anti-physic properties of a spinning globe. Which is a new idea anyway. As such, this term ‘two great lights’ could it be those are in fact the only two great lights? Do planets exist or are they just another type of star?

## Water
The first living creatures were sea creatures. Was there a 1st sea creature or where they all made in tandem? Notice that evolution also starts with water but has no explanation where water came from. Some giant fire cracker made water? Please.

## Simple sign as significant sign
Abraham’s servant asks God for a basic action (Watering of Camels) to be a sign of who Isaac’s wife will be

## Did the angel really not know?
The Angel asks Lot if He has anyone else in the city; sons, sons-in-law. Did the angel’s really not know? Or is this an insight into the our gracious relationship with the unseen?
