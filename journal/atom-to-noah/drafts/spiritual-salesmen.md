# motives and credibility

There’s a style of life called Multi-level marketing. The concept is your friends are your customers. I say it is a lifestyle because once you commit to it, then those of us who are not committed, will question your motivies. Are you friends with me or am I just a customer.

I have started to get the same with people who teach and preach the bible. If I find that they get financially compensated, I have trouble knowing why they say the things they do. The concept of clergy and laity is pagan and as such, those who live with such distinction are suspect to me.

I am a student of life and the One who gave Life. I have come crossroads with who my Maker is and how He wants me to live my life. I can say that I am coming these conclusions without any assistance of a Sunday Church Service. 

# theologians

one of the troubles I have with reading biblical commentaries is that men are guilty of the very thing they contend with. In once sense they explain how a view is wrong but do so with such conviction that they do not consider that they too may be wrong. And so the cycle goes.

I cannot help but read a tone from the words chosen by the author. Are they truly as dogmatic as they seem about such incredibly difficult and differing interpretations of the exact same words? Or, are they simply poor communicators. Maybe, they simply do not edit their own words and consider how they might sound to the very audience they attempt to influence. Or, are they simply preaching to the choir and forget the purpose of the subject and decide to focus on support and professional reputation. 

Well, I have no choir and I have no sales pitch. I am on a quest to learn the bible. The reality is that I have come to see that it is a personal journey. For no two people will agree on the text. As such, I am interested in listening to your views but also why you hold such views. The reality is that how you present yoru views is as important as what those views are. You may be ‘right’ but the chances are low that you are. I will accept the same changes of my own journey. For, I would rather stand before judgement with 10 lines of personal opinion about the bible for which I do not have 100 because of the time it took for those 10 RATHER than know 100 of other theologians views and never actually have read the bible directly myself.

It’s also a matter of quality of life issue. I would rather spend my time reading the bible directly than spending time sifting through men of quesitonable credibility to even speak on  such subjects. As I’ve come to discover, the majority of those voices on the scriptures do so for financial reasons. So, in that sense, they have a conflict of interest. I want to hear the truth even at the cost of money.

So here’s what I would say if I were able to speak to the theologians of the ages. What is the motives of your message? What is the end game of your views? How did you arrive at those views? How much of what you are teaching is through direct study of the subject inside scripture, yourself? Are you providing commentary on a subject that you have studied personally, or simply checking it off your spiritual merit badge list. 

The trouble I have with preachers is they are human. They cannot possibly know as much as they proport. So they are either counterfits, shallow, or speak to a dead audience. The time it takes to truly understand a subject takes hours. They are teaching us how to swim while standing on the beach. I have trouble listening to those kinds of people. Think of all these spiritual celbrities in our history - Calvin, Luther, Spurgeon, Stanley. They have made the doctrine their profession.

But what I’m having difficulty accepting is how much of it is the truth? Having spent a year studying Genesis, I simply recognize I’m merely scratching the surface! At this pace, it would take me roughly 50 years before I have personally understood the bible, yet we have 20 something pastors with a set of bible trivia facts standing up weekly. I was pleased to discover that the whole system is a racket.

Those who know the text the best tend to be the most humble. Why? Because the more you spend on the text, the more you realize how vast it is. One person cannot possibly know with absolute certainty what these texts mean in light of the others. Debate at the surface level simply becomes ‘whack a mole’ where theologians fight verse vs. verse to prove why their view is the right one and others are wrong. It’s the classic 6 blind men touching the same elephant from different places.

I am going to write in the way I wish to read. I am going to explain why I _currently_ see and understand knowing full well that I am looking through a glass dimly. However, I am looking and desiring to look with better clarity and as such I will articulate what I see in hopes of improving my own understanding as well as that of those who may see even less clear. 

Your time is your time and same goes for mine. I am going to write what I see, learn, and know but I have limited interest in debating other views. That doesn’t mean my views won’t change, but I am not motiviated by converting other people or proving their views are wrong. It is only in my quest for my own understanding where I may chose to highlight differences and why I chose to agree or disagree with the statements. 

It’s as if theologians are trying to poach the followers of one to their view because they have figured it out. 

I’m going to study the bible and seek God for my own soul and salvation. I hope that my quest is pure, right, and helps others do the same but you are not my focus, God is my focus. I want to get my own soul ready before I meet Him.

The pit in which I find myself is one of protestant origins. The lies I am trying to shed are those shoved in my face about who Yeshua was, what we are apart of, and how to live as a Christian. It feels like the goal of church is to make people not like it. To associate God with such a repugnant entity and repell people to
