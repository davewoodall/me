# your time is your time.

you were given time by God. What will you do with your time? Your time is your chance to choose. However, some people will choose what you do with your time. That can be your boss, or a slave owner. A dictator, or a loved one. But you must know that no one will be held accountable for your time.

Time is the most precious resource. You must learn to use your time wisely. There are many people who will tell you directly and indirectly how to spend your time.

When it is your turn to choose how you spend your time then you should do what you can to choose what is right.
