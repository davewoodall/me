Aaron Peterson:
    I think trying to figure out the behavior of God is like a tadpole trying to figure out human behavior. I know we are image bearers so I'm going with the father/son relationship that I know 
David Woodall:
    i agree we have no clue - so why do so many christians act like we / they do?
    if i am a tadpole, then what are my attempts for?
    and… who are they for?

-------------------

David Woodall:
    serious question - now that we know we’re not going to hell, what’s the reason we seek out God now?

steve woodall:
    Should we continue to sin that grace may abound? God forbid!
    That is what the bible says right?
David Woodall:
    not even go so far as to continue in sin, but to question the relationship and our status with it

steve woodall:
    My question is, why is my relationship with God 100% opposite in EVERYSINGLE WAY from the relational structures he created on earth?
David Woodall:
    i’m just wondering, why do I pray? is it to hope i get what i want? Santa style?
    health, wealth, happiness
steve woodall:
    That is the question
David Woodall:
    am i guaranteed some kind of reward for doing something by faith? how do i know that what i want / need / do is even right?
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    serious answer consideration for serious question:  could it be compared to healthy eating?  There are benefits to eating real fresh food over the tastier/instant gratification of fast food.
    I would consider life in the Spirit, wisdom from God, peace from our Savior to be benefits of fresh food.
David Woodall:
    i don’t know. I look at my coworkers and atheist cousin and they all seem to be laughing as much as I do at work
    they even enjoy more beer than i do
steve woodall:
    One could argue, even more so
David Woodall:
    and they even seem to get paid more and have nicer things
    and when i talk about God, they shrug
    hey, i don’t even like talking about God as much as you don’t like listening, pal.
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    Rich and poor have this in common:
    The Lord is the Maker of them all.
    I think there is a sow/reap principal at play here.
David Woodall:
    unto what tho
    what am i going to reap, and when?
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    I’m not sure that office laughter and leased bmw’s is a large enough slice or perspective to compare.
David Woodall:
    what if i just say ‘hey, i’ll get as much, more, or less than my legalist counterparts’
steve woodall:
    This isn't the right forum for me on this question although I have many thoughts that make me angry
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    again, these questions are based on the assumption that God does exists and does care.  He is not absent, apathetic or angry.  Correct?  Is the question then “so what?”
steve woodall:
    "Who the hell knows" seems to be an appropriate response that would cover this.
    Why does he play hard to get and whisper so silently. I don't do that to my kids
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    Or is the question being presented in a vacuum outside of eternal ramifications?
steve woodall:
    Either way, all we have is what we know and he is like the riddler... Why be so mysterious "since" you love us so much
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    Steve, perhaps the strategy is similar to why parent’s let their kids have puppies and learn responsibility.
steve woodall:
    We are created to think about today and it not normal for us to operate in a eternal perspective. Why does he operate on a system that we don't seem to be created to understand
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    I’m not sure I agree that we’re designed to think about today.  I believe we’re more wired to ponder what is beyond, but distracted by what’s in front of us.
steve woodall:
    It's all so forced and hard for what we are preached to believe
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    Same goes for why we can often neglect our primary relationships at home in lieu of time with strangers or acquaintances.  
steve woodall:
    Ponder maybe, buts it's all abstract wonder.
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    I understand and feel your frustrations with the system, but I’m not totally sure I’d like the other option.
steve woodall:
    These questions sure do rattle in my mind...
David Woodall:
    sorry boss is here…brb
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    A physical God with an audible voice is kind of a catch 22...
    I want credibility in my God.
steve woodall:
    I don't like the other option either... My frustration lies in what I feel is inconsistencies in what we are told god is and what my reality of him is. 
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    To know that my God is SO BIG that He can handle everything.
    I think of Moses who saw his back
    I don’t think we could handle any alternative. 
    true.
steve woodall:
    He is the creator of us... Why not create us a little stronger to handle more then? He is all powerful
    It's all a bit underwhelming
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    Would you have preferred to not see your boys grow up?  To have them born as capable men?
steve woodall:
    That's my point... I see them watch them relate with them and them with me... Where is god
    My relationship with my boys is not at all like my relationship with god
    I "hope" I am interpreting him correctly. 
    Would I be a good father if I only left my boys letters addressed to other boys and believed they would feel my full encompassing love for them? 
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    What do you believe is your boys current thought or perception of the food and shelter you provide to them?  Do you think they think about it at all?
    Where do you envision your boys are when they are reading these letters?
steve woodall:
    Exactly... Underwhelming if god is my source if food and shelter
    Having a cup of coffee for 15 mins in the morning
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    agreed if that is where it stopped.
    but I believe your provision for them is not the goal...but one of the foundations for them.  A springboard in order to have safety and find life and experience beauty.
    basic provisions allow for explorations outside of basic provisions.
steve woodall:
    Either way, Christianity throws the term intimacy around way to much in regards to our relationship with Christ. That goes way beyond food and shelter.
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    In such a way, I wonder if creating a system like a family where we are fathers and parent and work and struggle, could be considered basic provisions that give us platforms to seek truth and peace and wisdom that will be manifested in eternity.
    David wrote about the idea as well.
steve woodall:
    Then I am either angry at God or every Christian that tries to promote god as this all fulfilling intimate relationship doing life together.
David Woodall:
    sorry i have to bail on this. maybe that’s spiritual warfare. I’ll read these when my boss leaves… 
steve woodall:
    He is more like a man that puts up fences and let's it all happen as it does within those parameters.
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    “John Woodall was truly guided by the Spirit to be funny...”  Wow.  Dad, shoot us some of those holy jokes!
    I just in from the Bible belt...and lost my pants!
    * I just flew in..
steve woodall:
    All I'm saying is I believe I was created with a logic that applies to every aspect of life except in what is to be the closest/ best relationship ever. Makes it a little difficult.
David Woodall:
    hey just read these texts. sorry i had got interrupted what a timing
    mike, i like some of your questions
    steve, i’m more with you - but with less of the anger
    i’m trying to figure out what the ‘alternative’ to not following God. 
    for people who believe in Him
    like, what’s the worst that could happen? I succumb to what everyone else does but don’t go to hell?
    my marriage is definitely hitting rough patches and it makes me pray and humble myself
    i believe in the power of God but i don’t feel like He is ready for me to have any of it.
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    That sort of sounds like the Prodigal son.
steve woodall:
    I agree with that last statement
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    “give me what I deserve so I can take it off this farm.”
David Woodall:
    i’m not asking to take it off, i’m asking ‘is there a farm?’
steve woodall:
    I believe, but don't understand why it's so hard, yet preached to us that it's easy
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    is that your premise?
David Woodall:
    my premise - i’m doing the work, i’m not a slacker, why am i doing it again?
    i’d like some power to overcome a lot of myself
    or maybe share something about God that other people benefit from
steve woodall:
    Exactly
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    I still submit that there are benefits of “good clean living” that don’t involve eternity.
David Woodall:
    yes, of course
    but is that it?
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    + eternity
    😊
David Woodall:
    b/c i knew that would be the retort - it’s more wise for us to live this way
steve woodall:
    😍
David Woodall:
    less STD’s
    thinner
    more money for retirement
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    I say happier...in the non-hedonistic definition
David Woodall:
    first off - i’m not proposing turning from God
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    perhaps the question isn’t what are the benefits of following God, but rather why am I not a hedonist?
    is that too narrow of a focus for the discussion?
David Woodall:
    it’s more like - we’re all born in Atlanta
steve woodall:
    I'm not saying turning from god either. 
David Woodall:
    i’m told New York is North, yet others believe it’s south, east, and west
steve woodall:
    My personality only wants that Christianity would preach the truth of the reality if god
David Woodall:
    i’m somewhere north of Atlanta, maybe in Virginia
steve woodall:
    Of what god really is
David Woodall:
    atheists are in Alabama
    and when i tell them they are going in the wrong direction, they say - all these highways look the same and i don’t have any problems in this course
    and i don’t stop at as many rest stops b/c i’m trying to get to New York
    but, why am i going so fast? what’s the rush?
    and who’s to say i’m not going North East?
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    Dave, how do these new questions reconcile with the some of your previous thoughts/idea that included “Just as the lungs weren't made for water, our souls can't handle darkness.”
    These new questions, that I recognize are not “doubt,” seem to indicate that you’re asking about a path in life that you’ve heard exists but can’t seem to find it.  Like El Dorado.
    I’ll agree that none of us wants El Dorado Christianity.
David Woodall:
    If I do. If I don’t. I don’t see a difference
    i’m half way done with life now. what am i to be focusing on?
    i guess i’m starting to wonder what i should take seriously
mike.woodall@icloud.com:
    
    And if we’re swimming...we better learn how.
    learning how involves some “clean living”
    ...and the hope for shore.
    brb
David Woodall:
    keep your nose clean and eyes in the boat and life will be better than the other way.
    part of why i ask is that i feel like i’m letting go of a lot of things and some of those things may have been misperceptions of how my relationship with God works
    i’m letting go of retirement, savings, plans, goals, purpose, even bodily concern (because i’m seeing my body as a cocoon) for eternity
    but if i peer too deep into spirituality, i’m left with a - peaceful sense to just live out today but not much more.
    did you guys read my outline of the ‘book’ ?
    http://cl.ly/XpQt
    i suppose much of what this talk is - is related to part 4 of that outline.
    i think we are here until our banana rots
    when it does, we’ll be born again - but really for the first time.
    what did I do in the first womb? why not just live that same way again?
    if i’m being born again, am I currently in utero?
