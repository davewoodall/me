# The day after.

it's like a weight on my soul. hard to breath. It's like my peripherial vision has blurred. My ability to see is only for the task at hand.

I know have a switch that will turn me off and tune me out to the task at hand.

I also now have a constant fast. When I think of Olivia, I will turn to him.

He said, don't look at olivia, look at Me.

He told me not to think of everything or everyone, but to only think of myself. Not in a selfish way, but in a way that will permit me to listen and obey to Him as He calls me.

I marvel that humanity would completely write off this innate voice and portion of who they are and suggest that it is not supernatural. Almost to the degree that I say, why don't you cut open your chest and make sure there is a heart if you're going to doubt it. I conclude that their evolution, atheist ways are their way of telling God they are angry with him for things that have happened to them. I feel for them. Wells says, there is no such thing as an intellectual athesist and I have to agree.
