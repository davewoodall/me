1 foot in eternity 
one foot in this place

# I have no kingdom.

I have no wealth.

Peace is with us. 

In my kingdom things are to be a certain way. But a kingdom can only be of one and I am apart of His kingdom, and so is Peace. 

His ways are not my ways but that does not make me try to fight for the throne. 

Children are in my line, but they are not mine. 

## the magic mirror
When you find the mirror in your spirit, you will see a reflection of yourself. But it is not you, it is God. Because you were made in His image and you look like Him and He looks like you.
