Why be here at for such a short time? 

Life is meaningless if you think the point is to work for temporary things. But it has purpose when you know we’re here for a purpose larger than we can comprehend.

you need < 70 years to be formed before you’re born again.
to form your spiritual eyes, ears, nose, mouth, fingers, toes, legs, mind, heart, ass.

why do you / i / we want a BMW? so that people will look at us an admire us and make us think we’re not a couple of ass holes. 

The only reason i want a house, bigger than i have now is to have people look at me with respect, honor, and admiration.
Why do i have the car i have? So that I learn who I should be admiring.
