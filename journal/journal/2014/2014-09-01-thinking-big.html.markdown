I think of myself as a boat without a rudder. I was seeking to know what.

I was seeking the question 'what am I supposed to do' from 17. I did not have a clear understanding of how I was supposed to be. During my 20's I read broad in a search for answers. I read a lot of self help books. Titles like 'think and grow rich', 'magic of thinking big', 'see you at the top', 'glen bland method', 'how i raisd myself from failure to success in selling'. All in all, probably 20 titles on the topic.

It seems like I was thinking about the wrong things. That I should be thinking big. When my first t-shirt company had fallen apart, I figured I had the right stuff but it was just channeled in the wrong area.

I concluded that my problem was I hadn't had the right education. So, I concceeded defeat and started my search for business school. I was going to make up for lost time by attending real estate school adn get an MBA while I was there.

My failures and wandering were not going to hold me back.

During this time, the real estate markets were booming so I thought maybe I should get into real estate since t-shirts weren’t working out. I looked into real estate programs and ultimately found one in Denver. I had loved Colorado for 10 years and when the thought of using grad school as the responsible reason to move West, I moved forward with it. I was accepted to DU as a dual-degree program of real estate development and MBA.

Before I had begun classes, Danae and I were at the library and she randomly found a book on the shelf that described nearly the exact vision of what I had thought I was going to school for. So, I picked it up and read [new harvest]() excited to get some prep. What shocked me was that I had realized that industry was not for me in the slightest.

I called my admissions counselor and explained the situation. He said that I could switch no problem and that the way the dual degree worked, I could delay any other decisions about the MBA stuff. I ended up switching out of the Real Estate and enrolled in the Masters of Finance program.

I was 31 years old when I enrolled in the program. I was on the older side. The kids I was around made me think that I had not yet found my audience. After talking with Danae, I started to think that an MBA is only worth something if it’s from a top 5 school. So, I ended up unenrolling from the MBA side and just focused on the Finance.

By this time I was convinced that my past woes were due to my short sighted thinking. that the world was really mine and anyone's for the taking.

I was only in school for one semester when I took a class trip to New York. The real reason I took that course was it would enable me to take a road trip to visit top 10 MBA schools. I drove and visited the campuses of Harvard, Wharton, Darden, University of Michigan, University of Chicago, Kellogg. My dad flew out and visited 3 or so with me.

Taking that tour at 31 was something I wish I did at 17. To see and experience what was possible. I was so excited about the possiblities of getting my life back on track.
