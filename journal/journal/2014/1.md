# The plot thickens, Peter Pan.

## my childhood
- it was good
- it was fun
- friends
- no responsibilities
- contained
 
## Question - was it such a shock?
If you were a child, then it's like a warm blanket. who wants to grow up. 
I was thrust into adulthood.

## adulthood
- start wondering what people do all day
- start thinking about things you want 
- money, motives, marriage, motorcycles
- adulthood happened in spurts
- marriage
- provision
- success
- health
- wealth

## Question - how did you handle the wake up call?
It was a sense of urgency and anxiety for me.
