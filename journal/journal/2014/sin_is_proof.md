# Sin is proof
Sin is proof that God has given us true freedom

for those of us who want Him, He says ‘There is one kingdom, and it’s not yours.’

What if He knows what we need and it’s cancer, death of children, and poverty


Maybe i’m mad that God didn’t let me live my fantasies. But, who says my fantasies would scratch the itch that created those fantasies. 

Will we still trust Him?

It gets easier to trust Him as I begin relinquish all my personal ambitions of wealth, status, and accomplishment

Need something to embrace?  Try isolation and obscurity and discover how surprisingly refreshing they are when you stop chasing your kingdom.
