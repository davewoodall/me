# The gospel according to Dave

1. the plot thickens peterpan
- life is good when you have no worries.
- time to grow up and face responsibilities
An observation how life changes from youth to adulthoood and how do you make the switch? The changes force you to change.
- Life is perfectly created for you to know God.
- I'm 37 and looking back on my childhood. There are several studies that explain how much your childhood forms your views of life. I even heard it qutoed that the.

“The creative adult is the child who survived.” Ursula K. Le Guin

Next thing you know you are living a routine. Bills, chores, work, kids. The monotony is totally different than what you lived as a child. Is life supposed to be lived as it was, or as it is now? Am I doing something wrong? Would a trip to Iceland for a month solve all of my problems?

I grew up in Orlando, FL. 

Are we supposed to hold onto our youth? Or, was it just a stage that people don't know how to archive properly?

Our lives prepared us in such a way to encounter our adulthood. 

2. living like lucifer
- business books and goal setting. I was the king of my castle
- growing 

3. Hidden Treasure
- we avoid pain but in the pain and darkness we learn new things.

4. Royal DNA
- that desire to be treated like a king was simply misguided

5. Eyes not necessary
- this world is a 2nd womb. the purpose of earth is to handle what you could not handle if you were birthed directly into eternity.

6. Where God is
- God does not meet you in your soul, He talks to you in your spirit and it sounds like your voice.

7. Walk the line
- as your new life forms you begin to move from living in grace, to living in Victory
