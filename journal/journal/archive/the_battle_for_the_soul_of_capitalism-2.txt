The battle for the soul of capitalism
=====================================

Problem

Purpose
Same old call for change and reform.
Corporate America’s ethics and morals are shot and the author is
venting in words longer than necessary.
Poorly written and wordy.

American capitalism has been taken over by greedy managerial power.

Author’s Insight
All relationships are based on trust and businesses should recognize
they should be too.

The call is to put the greater interest of others and our dignity of
our own character first. and our own self-interest second.

Examples
challenges of the mutial fund industry where the managers have more
control than the owners/shareholders.

call for change and reform to the people’s voice and defense within
our system.
If not us, then the government will step in.

Our financial institutions are run by nice people who are put in a
place of compromise and chose their compensation and greed over their
role. Bogle calls it “Piracy”
