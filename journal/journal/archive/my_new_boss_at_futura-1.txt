My &quot;new boss&quot; at futura
=======================

Last week jon hired a new guy named scott to be director of
operations. We spoke for the first time yesterday and had a great
conversation for about an hr.
A man with 20 years experience and the ability to turn companies
around, it sounds like he is the ideal person to help out futura.

I'm wondering if this is the time for me to consider taking my first
step back. We now have 3 new people in there and the Lord has been
gracious to give us $50,000 in sales this first month with AMB3R.

This only adds to the level of adventure. I had assumed I was going to
work Futura throughout school. I'm not sure I still have that
confidence.
