Dear Dad,

Where were you? 
I could have been something truly great. Over the past 4 years I received a patent, got a masters in Finance, won small business of the year, and launched a business that is still in existence, even with my co-founder undergoing chemotherapy.

I should be going to Harvard. I should be on track to be president of the United States of America. 

But no, instead I am not going. They rejected me. Twice. And you know why *twice?* Because I don't give up. I persist. I have the smarts, determination, and resolve to pursue challenging things that could fail. 

But I can't blame them. While I have a good four year run, I'm 34 years old. They probably asked themselves, "WTF was this guys doing for the first 30 years of his life?… It's odd that he doesn't seem to have anything going before then."

You didn't prepare me for all the work I would have to do to care for Danae. Her wounds run so deep that it seared her virtue. She is someone who needs care, but I didn't realize that since you didn't really prepare me for how to care for a wife, either. Now I work as hard as I do in hopes just to break even. I was really hoping I could make to Harvard so that there I could meet a business partner, or go to a company where my income would outpace her spending. 

You know what I did with my youth? Not much. I played baseball… barely. Why the Fuck did you not go to my baseball games? God knows you didn't have a job or career to attend. Maybe I have a bad memory, but all I know is that I missed you being at games more than seeing you at them. Had you had a career maybe you would have told me how to get one of those. Or, maybe you could have told me to go to college so I could learn a career so not to be wandering along. 

It's 11:32pm on a Thursday night, and I'm writing this letter from my office. You know why? B/c I work two nights a week - late to try to make sure I can figure out how to pay my bills. Why is someone - who should be attending Harvard - having to be at work 15 hours a day to try to pay bills? Because I have yet learned how to provide for my family. I tried so many different things in life that I have painted myself in a professional corner. I don't know what kind of job i'm good at. So I just go work on my own business - trying to figure out how to use all of my variety of skill sets convert into a profitable business. 

When all the business schools said "no" I had foolishly told my employer I was leaving. I wish I could have gotten some kind of practical advice from you to keep my mouth shut about my intentions until they were true. Now, I am working AMB3R, which is covering about 60% of what I need to make. (I wish that stopped Danae from spending… but it doesn't). But no, you like the idea of family but your actions show you have little interest in really investing time or effort into me or my success. How many books are you reading, or have read and how many of those have we discussed? 

I can hear it now "but Dave, you have been busy." Yeah, I got busy over the last 4 years trying to stop from going 100K in debt from my marriage. Since my lifestyle wasn't working - I had to figure something out. How about we talk about where were you when I was 5 - 30? I know, you and mom were wrestling with your parents and your own struggles. Your lack of interests is fewer than you realize, you don't have interests in your kids - and after recently thinking about it, I wonder how much interest you have in mom. (Not enough to model to me how I should have intimacy with my wife, that's for sure.) I think you like being the guy that everyone things has all the answers and is so great at training kids. (Hey Johnny, look in my eye and squeeze my hand) It seems that your life is complete when someone thinks "Wow, if John does that with my kids, I wonder how well he trains and instructs his own kids." Well I'll tell you how much - Jack Shit. 

You didn't teach me to manage money, find a job, acquire a skill, learn a craft, cultivate romance, or how to learn. I am having trouble thinking if you even suggested I consider college. Lord knows, that if that Liberty flier hadn't come in the mail - I wouldn't have even gone to college!

Dad, I've wasted at least 15 years of my life because you talked an empty talk. You mislead me to thinking that a you were a good man that had the answers, when in fact you were the cover of a good man. There was no substance underneath. All these people told me how great you were. How could I argue with witnesses? I must be a slow learner not to grasp the deeper truths you were a celebrity for. But now I think you had us all fooled… You have a fetish with the bible, but I think because it's the book that attracts you the most attention. Why are you so self-absorbant to journal so much - about nothing? I might be interested in reading your journals if I felt there would be something in them that had substance. 

You will never see this letter. You know why? Because you wouldn't be able to handle it. You would internalize, process, and want to keep life in your own perspective. I love you and think of you as a really swell guy.
