# alignment

Alignment is a valuable trait.

My wife is not interested in speaking to me during the morning time.
Work requires my attention during the work time.
So that leaves if I am going to do anything for my time investing, it has to be in the mornings.

It's the same as what the richest man in babylon will teach you, to pay yourself first.
