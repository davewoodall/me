With that stated, imagine a local community church like this. What if in the same 2 - 4 hour span you could have everyone totally engaged and passionate about discovering God, being together in fellowship, and loving their experience so much they insist on bringing their friends.

Imagine on Sunday 10 am you walk into a central gathering room. The environment is conducive to conversation with booths, coffee tables, nice lighting, music, wireless Internet, coffee and sandwich bar, smiling cocktail waitresses, and a hostess even there to greet you.

You are handed a bulletin. In it you find the schedule of events from 10 am until 2 pm.
These events are all going on at the same time. The bulletin is actually more of a menu in format.
On your menu you see there are 13 different activities that you can participate in to discover God however you want:

### The menu would read:
Room 1. Worship 10 am - 2pm. Non-stop praise and worship. Sing as long as you like.

Serve Trip: Going to local mission to feed the poor. Van leaves at 10:30 returns at 1:30

In addition, I see weekly small groups meeting, weekend retreats, and collective gatherings.

I wouldn't be suprised if people began requesting the church doors and rooms to be open more often than Sunday's.
If this church was to open it's doors 7 days a week, I would think it could become a hangout for mom's to bring their kids and a community center for teens for after school. Basketball, skate park, climbing walls, etc.

On Elders: I see that they would be at least 1 Elder per "room". He or she would be either directly leading that room, or Mentoring the person who was.

If Church were done this way it would be different each and every week. You may participate to learn. You may Participate b/c of a close friend wants to. But the point is we are discovering God together in the season and place we're at.
