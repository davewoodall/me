# 2 Tips for Dad's on how to make friends.


1. ------------------
If you ask a dad who are his good friends, he'll likely name his college buddy, or similar friend from a past era. Why don't dads mention anyone from the present? It's because dads have trouble making friends. I have noticed it's because of two main reasons. 

2. ------------------
First, dads want to use their limited time doing their passion.

Life is so busy that I have little time outside of work, family, and chores. If they have a passion, they want to spend that precious time doing that passion. Dads would rather do their passion solo, than spend time with a bunch of dull dads.

3. ------------------
Second, is most dads can be real dull. 

I have trouble with prolonged chit-chat. When we have a community outing, I am thinking ofthe guys who will be there that I can talk about something exciting.  I think this is where beer is becoming so popular, because it helps numb the dullness. People without passion are dull.

4. ------------------

I've succeeded if my goal was to depress you. But, there are actually two reasons Dads should try to find friends.
I'll give you two reasons why it's worth it to make friends in your 30's.

## Reason 1: dads need help doing diffuclt things.
Have you ever heard of laird hamilton? He's a world class surfer who surfs 100' waves. The guy is a monster machine. But you know what? He's not fast enough to catch those waves on his own. He needs someone on a jetski to tow him into the wave. Macho Laird needs someone in order that he can fulfill his passion.

5. ------------------
Laird hamilton lives his passion because he asks for help. 
Laird's passion is a difficutl one for him.

6. ------------------
The word _difficult_ is relative to everyone. What's difficult for one man is not difficult for another.

Camping is hard for me to do. The planning. The equipment. The location. There are so many little details that I have never had the time or money to acquire. Camping is difficult for me, so I asked for help. 

It's something that I can get excited about because it's new and different and I can follow an expert.

Jeff towed me into the wave I couldn't do on my own. In the process, we've become good friends.

8. ------------------
## Reason 2: You get to pursue your passion.

I love to program. I'm more than happy to help and talk with anyone who wants to learn. On the very rare occasion someone does ask, I break my routine and help them. Why? Because it's a passion of mine. I get a thrill in seeing people migrate to Internetland. If you can't believe passion is self-gratifying, then consider it my calling.

9. ------------------
Men who have passions, glady share them. Point one (time strapped) means that even passionate dads don't get to do what they love as often as they like. 

10. ------------------
So, when Jeff Mr camping hears I need help, he gladly offers it. Jeff was more than happy to share camping with me. So, it was a safe ask for me to ask him about camping. 

11. ------------------
But, this brings up a good point. If you want to ask, then you have to possess a passion for something. 

12. ------------------
_A sub-point to this post is that Most dads don't have a wave, a passion, to ask for help about. Let me be more blunt;_

13. ------------------
_What is your passion?__
_What are you doing about it?_

_What do you want to be?_
_Who can you ask help for?_
_If you don't know, what are you doing to find those people?_

13.a ------------------

# How to become friends in your 30's
## (To be read as a poem.)

I met Jeff.
He shared his passion.
We became friends.

15. ------------------
 to learn to camp. And Jeff had a passion to share camping. We were able to bond in such a way we've become friends.

16. ------------------
- dads need to find their passion
- dads need help to do difficult things
- dads with passion are happy to help















## Outline
#### 0. Laird Where' tow-in came from
- he's a macho man that needs help
- if he needs help, you do to.

#### 1. Men, as friends, towing each other in (being on the jetski)
Tow in surfing is where one person wants to do something that is beyond his own ability. This means two things. One that you have a specific target you were made, or want to do. And that you have people around you that can help you do it.

## 1b. What is your wave?
What do you want to do in life? What are you called to do? Can you define it. I think people try by making empty mission statement documents trying to outline an ideal self that they want to live up to. I'm not describing that. I'm talking about taking time to take inventory of who you are and how you are wired.

## 1c. What is your jet ski?
Not that you are looking for things to do, but have you been able to define and articulate how you can help other people? What are your strengths and passions that you would be more than happy to help people with?

#### 2. Jeff
- he's a pro and he pulled me into a wave I couldn't do myself
- living in boulder, I wanted to take advantage but didn't know how.

Laird Hamilton surfs waves so big that he cannot surf them alone. He needs someone to tow him into the wave. 

Big wave surfing is a perfect analogy for community men want to be apart of.

I am of the opinion community requires both side of that relationship.
Someone wanting to surf a wave so big, that he needs help to do it.
And a supporting cast around him to tow him into that wave.

I find that most dads I talk to don't even have a wave they want to surf.
So they don't get it when I ask them to help tow me into my wave.

This is part of male maturity.
To do some serious soul searching and discover something big in your heart you want to pursue.
It doesn't have to be a life goal, but something that is hard and makes you nervous thinking of it.
Something that has a chance of failure.

Male community thrives when the men of the circle participate on both sides of the relationship.
Where the question can be answered;
_What is your wave that I can tow you into?_

#### Requirements
Consider what's required to answer that question.
First, you need to have a wave to surf.
Second, it has to be so big that you can't do it alone.
If you don't need someone to tow you into your passion, is it because it's small, or you simply haven't found your wave?

### Ask
Only in community can you **ask** the question:
_What is your wave that I can tow you into?_
You have strengths that help others. As you hear what other men need, you will discover ways to apply your passions.

Each man should have a big wave he needs to towed into.


### Find your wave.
### Get towed in.
### And tow others.
