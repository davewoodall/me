Thanks, GT.

I can only imagine the challenges you and the leadership team face in our situation.

Have you heard of Peter Thiel's book, Zero to One? It's a fast read and I wonder if it would be one that helps during these soul searching times.

If you don't have time or interest, I'll explain the part that stood out for me; Companies who go from nothing to something like google, space x, or facebook. Then, me too brands, where we describe ourselves to friends as 'We're a smaller Groupon'

It's an intersting question to ponder - not that we MUST become a company like that but how do we respond once we accept our roots. Our past can influence the future, but it shouldn't dictate it.

I'm rooting for you!


Hi Peter,

Just finished reading Zero to One.

Re: Founders Chapter
After reading your part about founding a company, I can honestly say I started my previous business in the exact opposite of what you descrive and can attest from the challenges there that you are correct.

Re: N+ companies
I now work for LivingSocial - arguable the epitome of a n+ company. On top of that, we just took on a new CEO and it's no secret that we're in a state of flux. What would you say to a company that recognizes it's an N company but wants to get away from that?

I just emailed our CEO and recommended your book. HOpefully he reads it and hopefully LS becomes a Zero type company!
