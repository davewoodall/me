#24 hours
The following is one way to divide 24 hours;
5a - 9a Morning
9a - 5p Work
5p - 9p Evening
9p - 5a Sleep

My wife is not interested in speaking to me during the morning time.
Work requires my attention during the work time.
So that leaves if I am going to do anything for my time investing, it has to be in the mornings.

It's the same as what the richest man in babylon will teach you, to pay yourself first.
