Jason, 

For the past two years at LivingSocial I was I could while writing code on four differnet teams. LivingSocial was a collection of nearly 70 different Rails apps, built by 170 engineers over the course of 9 years. I worked on four different teams with some extremetly talented individuals. At it's peak, LS was generating upwards of $1.5B in revenues but has yet to turn a profit. The company is also the most funded venture out of DC according to CBInights. It was a fantastic opportunity to get a glimpse of what a large scale app looks like. This makes Code my 5th vocation and the one I've spent the past Four years focused on. Some might consider my variety of jobs as an inability to commit, but I feel that it's been on a long term journey of CEO in training. I was a ceo of an 'old world, bootstrapped company' but I realized that I wanted to join the internet and started over again. I know enough code to continue this path and it is the vocation I will reamin until I am able to run a company again. 

There are three primary reasons I want to un-retire backpack;

## I love the product.

Nothing compares with it's simplicity, clarity, and effectiveness to keep me organized mentally and professionally. 


gather, read, and write content. 

Backpack is flat which means it has the least friction possible between logging in and reading and writing content. This is a big win for corporate writing when people can be less motivated to do a routine task. I just spent two years having to work with confluence and found the writing, finding, and reading experiences all to be draining to the point I used those tools as little as possible. I love that I was able to train non-technical people to use backpack to the benefit of the company. I was able to demonstrate that there was something to sell in 2012. I used backpack to replace myself with another art director and document my role at AMB3R in order to successfully sell to my business partner. Like Evernote, BP has. 

I started using backpack in 2007. In 2012 I heard about a lot of new competitors and I decided to try many of them. Evernote, Google keep, Remember the milk, private tumblr, basecamp, paper.dropbox.com, and even basic text files. I even went as far as making my own [version of backpack]() which addressed one issue I had with task apps. But in the end, I still prefer backpack. 

The fact that Backpack has been retired and looks the same as it did when I started using it in 2007 demonstrates that it design goes deeper than UI. The lack of a mobile experience does not impede me from doing using the software as it is intended; writing and reading content. Backpack stays out of the way unlike many of it's competitors who think users are there for the app. For example, Evernote focuses on tools to manage digital hoarding like folders, tags, and other admin, where backpack keeps the surface clear with the. 


## I want to expand your Kingdom.

I greatly respect you and David. I have read a significant amount of your collective writing and listened to many of your talks. I believe in your views about business, leadership, management, and software. I want to be apart of expanding your influence and continuing legacy.

I'm sure you've read that leaders look for leaders. If there was a leadership scale from 1 - 10, I'd put myself at a 6 and you and DHH at a 9 in order to say, I would follow your lead. The business style, the design style, the software style, the remote lifestyle, and your willingness to speak with conviction make me want to expand your kingdom and continue your legacy.  


##  It's a SAAS collecting dust.

Basecamp was my first exposure to software as a service and since then it has been my goal to own a saas business. Backpack is in tact and needs a leader to run it and I am requesting your permission to continue your vision.


There is nothing wrong with Backpack and it's now just sitting and collecting dust. After a couple years of neglect it could be 
After 17 years selling apparel the idea of SAAS is almost too good to be true. Backpack's business model would be something I would be aspiring to build on my own if I am not able to participate in your model. The BP model is fully in tact and I want to continue the mission. 


## 

I discovered Basecamp in 2007 and that was my first exposure to a SAAS model. I left a 17 year career in apparel to learn to code in order to build my own saas. Backpack is the business model I want to be in. bp is a turnaround story of unique opportunity. Not laden with Debt but has been largely neglected. My favorite projects are turnarounds (Ouray went bankrupt, bought by a PE firm, and they hired me as Art Directory to help turn around the company. We won small business of the year 2 years later.) I have nothing to lose by trying to make backpack great.

I am nothing short of a raving fan of both backpack and the larger organization you have built. I am applying for the opportunity to take the helm and lead a team of top talent with a mission of expanding your legacy by helping individuals and small businesses manage their content in a way that keeps them at the center, not our software. For me, this is is a chance to work on a product I love, with people I admire, toward a mission I believe in. 


## Vision

My vision is to pick up where you left off. Your decision to focus attention on Basecamp meant Backpack no longer received attention. And still, no one has picked up the baton. I want to be tasked with helping small businesses and people stay organized. 

There was nothing wrong with backpack. As a customer, I see nothing wrong with it on the inside. Backpack, as a product is as solid as ever. It only speaks this this fact in that I set out to find something to replace it and was unsuccessful. You were onto something and it seems from what you've written publicly, you decided to double down in order to grow and protect your 40 person team's lifestyle. I completely respect that.Backpack not only helped my businesses, it is the only site I visit on a daily basis _and_ the longest standing site I've paid for. I know I'm not the only one who is still passionate about Backpack. 

Not only does backpack represent a product I love, the chance to work on it with people I admire is another selling point. My list includes Yourself, DHH, and the remote LivingSocial Alum who are capable of solving big challenges. I believe the time is now to gather them to work on Backpack before they disband. 


Evernote fosters bad habits of digital hoarding and then taxes the users time with layers of folders and tags. Backpack is _still_ beautiful because it's flat design. "Flat" in terms of a flexible sidebar means that important content is one click away and the 'Action Bar' let's me build a page without leaving my train of thought. Backpack can compete against all note taking apps and win because reading, writing, and organizing are clean and easy.

It might have been easy to think that note taking apps were what BP was competing with because people were getting excited about Evernote. I admit that I tried evernote based on a few people I respect told me how much they used it. I gave it a try for about 3 months and realized it was a worse version. One of the main reasons was that the UI was more focused on itself than my content.  I can work my way down a page and add notes, tasks, without losing my train of thought. Reading and Writing are both a joy, which cannot be said of Evernote. I believe now is the time to return and take down the current leader. Now is the time to pick a fight with Evernote as it waffles and wades through leadership challenges and product bloat. 


## Structure

I assume you're asking about ownership and I must admit this is the part where people think I'm crazy for even asking. But I've seen how you worked with Highrise, Starter League, and Know Thy Company. This entire plan is based on good faith that you would be willing to explore something similar with Backpack. 

If I may deviate slightly and say that Backpack has some dust on it simply due to lack of attention. It speaks volumes that you are able to have a successful business run on auto-pilot as it does. While it is not considered a turnaround, I believe it will need some assistance before it can stand on it's own two feet again. And these are my favorite types of situations. I was hired by a PE firm who bought a bankrupt company and asked me to rebuild their Art Department. I managed a team of 9 artists on the '37suite' and two years later we won South Denver Small Business of the year. 

## How it would work

I would assume leadership and be responsible to assemble the team and grow the customer base. If Backpack were to become a second subsidiary then, to paraphrase your [blogpost](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3770-big-news-for-highrise), Backpack would become its own company, a subsidiary of Basecamp, with own team, board and budget. I assume Backpack has no debt and would be able to be funded by customer revenues. During the transition period, Backpack would lease some infrastructure from Basecamp, but ultimately itâ€™ll be completely self-sufficient.

The engineers and designers I have in mind are accomplished and love the idea of working together on reviving backpack. My role would be that of a sweeper with two primary responsibilities: profit and people. As a former graphic designer, art director, sales rep, business owner, with a Masters in finance, and a current occupation as a Rails Developer, I believe I am capable of filling in where the team needs. That includes customer service, wire framing, code, hiring, firing, blogging, managing the financials, and rolling with the punches.  I also have a Masters in Finance which helped me navigate cash flow challenges with AMB3R, as well selling the company. But my willingness to lead this team is by no means a perception that you and I are peers. I greatly admire your accomplishments, management style, and ___ to the point that I relish the thought that you would mentor and guide my leadership decisions.


## Plan

As far as the plan goes, if we started tomorrow, I would focus on the following, in order;

- Secure the [alpha team]()
- Agree on a transition plan and timeline.
- Determine the best course of action for a mobile friendly UI.
- Discuss the current backlog.
- Discuss the modern requirements
- Turn the lights on as it was before retirement.
- Handle [small improvements]
- Then, after our confidence is built, would we discuss [my wish list]
