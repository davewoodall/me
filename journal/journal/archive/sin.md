## 13. Sin is it's own punishment.
Sin is unnatural. We were not made to hold it. The eye doesn't need to be told that putting salt into it is wrong. It will quickly find out for itself. We don't sin because it is unnatural and wisdom teaches us that it will not fulfill any desire. It is not God's wrath that keeps us from sinning.
We do not need to waste time telling others that sin is wrong. They already know it. If your true desire is for them to know Christ, then spend time talking about Him and watch Life change happen.
