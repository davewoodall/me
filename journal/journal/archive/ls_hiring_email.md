Hey Starter Leaguers,

Here's my annual pitch for why Boulder, CO is where you should be.

I was fortunate to land back in Boulder, which according to Entrepreneur.com, we're the number 1 city for tech startups. Hey, I just report it. http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/227829

If the startup scene is not your thing, then how about the outdoors, weather, or microbreweries?
I made a list of my favorite things http://dave.woodalls.me/boulder

Are you wondering how you'll pay for your lift tickets?
Don't worry. I've got that covered for you as well...

Livingsocial recently sold something to Groupon for $250M. We are hiring 25 new devs. You can work remote, or near a hub (BOULDER!). The new strategy is focused on moving from 1B sales to multi-billion.

What that means for you is that you get support to help grow and learn. Livingsocial is a learning culture (read Hungry Academy), so this is a great place to grow your chops.

What now?
Send me your resume and I'll submit it to my HR people with an introduction.
