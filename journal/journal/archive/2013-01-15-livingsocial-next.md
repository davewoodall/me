It's been a week since the [CEO of Living Social announced he's stepping down](http://blog.livingsocial.com/tim-oshaughnessy-announces-that-he-is-stepping-down-as-ceo-of-livingsocial/).

During the follow up video call, The VP of Eng described the stages LivingSocial has gone through;

'A to B' (Customer discovery)
'B to C' (Funding)
'C to D' (Going public)
'D to E' (Current Status)

The D to E stage requires us to provide continual growth and earnings.
That's a lot of pressure, but we also have massive resources to accomplish the task.

I recently bought a Chromebook. It's the culmination of seamless interaction that reminds me of the first time I synced my Apple with itunes and my iPod. Google's vision is coming together with their diversification of tools (email, maps, chat, docs, hardware, hangout, and chrome). All of which have become part of our daily lives.

Google has become en-grained in our society and it feels like that should be LivingSocial's vision as well. (To become en-grained in people's daily lives.)

Our next leader needs to posses a big picture strategy to flank customers. If Google started at search, I don't see why we can't starting from commerce.

It seems to me that Google achieved their position through a "Let's throw things against the wall and see what sticks" strategy. They have a culture that is publicly known for it's exploration that has a first right of refusal to keep or kill ideas, like Google reader. That culture of exploration, without certain economic validation, is necessary if we're going to craft something people can't live without.
