Letter 1/28
===========

Danae,

I love you more now than when we first married. I love you and I love
us and I love being with you.

I'm sorry that I continued talking last night when I should have
stopped. I have that problem. I see a speech in my head and I have
trouble stopping before I feel I've completed it. I will pray about
that.

I feel there is some disconnect when I talk about what I'm calling
`below surface issues'. I feel you hear it as shots to your person and
you feel that I am not pleased with you. But that is not true and I
feel terrible when I hear you say that. It is because of your sweet
heart and love that I am who I am today. I am applying to Harvard
because you speak and have spoken words of life into me. I am soooo
grateful and I want to return the gift.

It doesn't sound like much, but I have given up many dreams and plans
about myself that I held as my identity because I like the dream of
pleasing you. One of my biggest motivators on work is to provide a 3
(or 4) bedroom place that you are proud of and can have room for your
family, and a dinning table for us to sit around again. I love being
with you.

I look back on our first five years with thankfulness. I think of how
gracious the Lord was to us and how much we learned and did. I have
also thought about this day for several years.... When we would be
married for `real'. I feel there are some intimacy issues we both have
and I want to break through them.

That's it for now.

Love,
me
