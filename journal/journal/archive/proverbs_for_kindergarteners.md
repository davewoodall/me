my son if foolish first graders invite you
do not go with them

if they say hide here. let's watch that girl fall

let's make fun of that fat kid
and make him cry to his mommy

we will get all kinds of candy
and have more chocolate than we can handle

we'll be fair and divide teh candy evenly

my son just ignore them
do not even laugh at their jokes

for they make fun of kids who have no defense

they do not see that soon they will be taken
by their so called friends

anyone who acts like these fools
will be had by these fools.
