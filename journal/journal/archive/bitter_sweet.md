# Bitter sweet

I found a song that describes what life will feel like as I breath my last breath. I imagine it will be a sort of slow motion experience so this 6 minute song encompasses 20 milliseconds as my life flashes before my eyes. 

My first instinct is a reflex of sadness. An inability to admit that life has come to an end. I justify my sadness as I ponder the things I will never achieve or archive. That I wanted more out of life than I was able to attain. 

My second sadness is regret for the friends and family I hurt and hurt me. That we have no more time to resolve those wounds to a level of complete satisfaction. I accept my scars but donâ€™t dwell on them. 

My thoughts narrow to Danae. I am astonished that in all the life we spent together, I only scratched the surface of who you are. I marvel at you. I realize my efforts to love were infinitely insufficient. I lived with a Queen who deserved much more. I have an inception moment and contrast who I was before and my life with You. You are the grace and glory of God and I love you.

I am grateful for how life actually happened compared what I imagined it should be. Life was far more adventurous and fulfilling. He knew what I needed and He lovingly orchestrated it. 
 
I settle my past and turn my focus to what is happening. I am stepping into eternity. The feast is about to begin and my Father is calling me to the world I was made for.

I close my eyes and exhale.
