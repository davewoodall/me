Hey Jon,

- Thank you for Futura and how it helped my marriage
- I really appreciated the work with futura
- Danae can testify, since i was working at home, that I poured my
life into this company
- as we mentioned that Scott is the solution to a company that was
`sick' yet i feel we accomplished a lot even though sick. For ex:
Toyota says: keep trying quote...
- I was enjoying the challenges while i was getting paid, but when
they started to affect my home life, that's when i had to make some
decisions.

- Lots of changes have already taken place this year and I wanted to
give you an update.
- I have looked into Business school and plan to attend this Fall.
- I want to go for several reasons - network out here in CO and to
build my professional skill sets.
- I approached you and you suggested an LLC
- I couldn't afford to do it on my own, and I was talking to Jeremy
and he and I joined up
- I think that futureshirts opportunities lay in where you are the
product developer and the passionate one. That seems to be in custom
items. I am very excited about these international opportunities.
- I would like to continue to work with futureshirts to offer these as
a contract employee
- Jeremy works at the factory that makes abercrombie tees and he has
broght to my attention that he can offer a faster, better, more
reliable applique service at a 36 piece minimum.
- I would like to continue working with futura and maintain my
existing clients inside futura
- in addition i would like to build the custom products division with
futura
- however, I feel that jeremy has a more distinct competitive
advantage and I would like to you to consider using him to supply you
with applique and all over print tees.
- You have my word that I will not solicit any futura clients to work
direct with AMB3R
