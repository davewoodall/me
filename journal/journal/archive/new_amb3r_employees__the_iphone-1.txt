New AMB3R employees &amp; the iphone
================================

James Lacroix and Carrie allen are helping us out. For the next 3
months to see how things go. James is an incredible artist and we're
hoping he takes the role of art director full time and even rolls in
his book of business. Carrie Allen is helping with some sales and
hopefully that too will pan out.

The new iphone just came out. I tried to wait in line, but 3 hours and
a chance of not getting it was to much. I went in yesterday and mail
ordered one to come next week.
Jeremy waited and got one.
I feel like with these phones it will enable our sales reps to be that
much more responsive to the needs of their customers. With Backpack as
the IT portion, it's really incredible how effective our sales reps
could be.

The next step is trying to figure out how to enable all customers to
pull up our site on their own...
