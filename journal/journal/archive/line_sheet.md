Background;

Dave Woodall invented Cat Math Do when his son, Oscar, was four years old. Dave noticed that Oscar didn't know the difference between the number 4 and the letter A. Dave explained that “Math is how numbers play together.”. Then, Dave told him there's a Math Playground that has five rides;  Plus, Minus, Times, Divide, and Equals. They started talking about the first two rides, 'Plus goes up.' and 'Minus goes down'. It wasn't long after that Dave converted that conversation into the first game of the Cat Math Do series.

Oscar is now 6 and as a family, we have played Cat Math Do nearly 50 times and still enjoy playing it. (Both Dave and Oscar :-)
Other games we play include Zingo, UNO, Checkers, Sequence for kids, and Connect Four. Cat Math Do fits right into our game session rotation. 

Because Cat Math Do is inexpensive to print, Dave made copies for other toddler moms. Their general response have been that through the playing, their child is introduced to math basics they otherwise wouldn't be through a formalized teaching process.

Dave is a graphic designer and computer programmer. He creates games as a way to teach his children. Some other Cat Math Do versions in the works are money, multiplication, and basic computer concepts.

Cat Math Do is
Simple - both in rules and few moving parts.
Fast - A game will last about 3 - 5 minutes. We end up playing 2 or 3 times.
Playful - Using basic game concepts to add some flavor to learning plus and minus
Inexpensive - Cheap manufacturing should make this game accessible for educational institutions to purchase it.
a Franchise - Plus / Minus is first of coming games. Other editions include multiplication, money, and basic computer concepts.
