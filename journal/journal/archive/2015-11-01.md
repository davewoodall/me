this is how I've been journaling my life lately. Just dated .md files that let me write as needed.

I am confused about how life in the Lord is to work. I recognize that He tells us that things are hard - but why so much and so long for me? On every front with nearly every relationship I am perceived as an odd dude. I don't mind that but I wonder why failure, setback, and a lack of reaping follow. Joseph seems to be the story I get related to. As if I'm entitled to relive his life in my own way. But I have come to the end of believing that I'm entitled to that. Now, I'm asking my final questions before I just give up completely. I'm starting to give up. While I am far from suicide, I have given up my standards about who I am and how I am to live. To the point that I am medicated nearly every day. I own my weakness, Lord. I am nothing but weak. I see that nothing in my life is by me or for me. Why was I prevented in all those previous attempts? Was I hanging out with the wrong people? Was I poorly educated? Did my father not prepare me? Was my heart so hard I needed to be broken? Whatever it may be - Lord, I know you're working all this out for good. You may slay me but You are entitled for You are my very breath. You are all I have for hope.
