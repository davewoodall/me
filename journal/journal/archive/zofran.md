Hello, 

We have 2 healthy boys and conceived our third child on May of 2013. Danae, my wife, started taking Zofran in June 2013. Olivia, our daughter, was due Feb 28. 
On January 28, 2014 Danae slipped on ice and fell on her stomach. Danae had been having routine doctor appointments and up until that point everything seemed to be normal. So she went in for a check to make sure everything was okay. The doctors noticed Olivia's heart was not beating as strong as it should and decided to perform an emergency c-section. 

Olivia was lifted to the children's NICU in Denver. We discovered she was born with both heart and brain defects that the doctors later determined were not due to the fall. They also were uncertain what caused Olivia's heart to fail. She passed away 14 days later, Feb 10, 2014. We also had genetic tests and other tests to try to find out what caused her heart to fail but have been unsuccessful. 

We have since gotten pregnant again (due 4/27/15... 2 weeks!). Danae did not suffer nausea this pregnancy and did not take zofran. Due to the loss of Olivia, Doctors have been extra careful to catch any warning signs during this pregnancy. All signs point to a healthy baby boy.

My creative brother made this during the time to ask for prayer:

We had setup a site to keep people updated:

We played this video at Olivia's funeral:

I am interested in speaking with you to know what our options are.

Thank you
