2/29/08 - Denver day two

Wow. we made it!
We packed it feels like for 2 weeks and then drove for 3 days to get here on Wednesday night. We are staying at hayes and kelly's house and it's pretty uncomfortable on the sleeper sofa with the bar in our backs.
I'm so tired.
The Lord is faithful and I can't wait to sit and meditate and pray on what He's been revealing to me.
Through this move He has brought to my attention my lack of compassion, sensitivity, impatience, fear, and just all out nasty flesh.
I don't want to supress it, but allow the Life and Blood of Jesus put to death that old nature.

More on this later...

## 2/19/08 - the invisible boy

There is a character in the movie Mystery Men named the _invisible boy_.
His power is to turn invisible, but only when no one is watching. If you look at him, he then can't become invisible.
Sometimes I feel like that with God. That as long as I don't really look at God and His moving in and around me, He will continue to do it. But when I begin to call out things and ways that I see Him working, it's like that falls apart.
While I'm still in transition here, I feel like it's happened roughly 3 times now during this move process. I may be over exaggerating due to my stress of living around boxes. Or maybe life is just like this..

But maybe my perception is reality for this season. What if God actually interacts in different ways to draw out different parts of myself. The good, bad, and ugly. That I may be aware, continually, of my own limitations and feebleness. For He alone is God and Ruler King in all domains.

My heart has been heavy after watching this first part of william young's story, the author of the shack. (theshackbook.com) That man has to sometimes go through those great sadnesses is just so heavy to comprehend.

Why wait until I'm at a point of Drunken stupor. I can call upon the Lord daily for salvation and establishment. Father, hear my prayer. May I not crumble in the day of adversity. May I stand on the Rock, which is Jesus in me. May I be found faithful and full of faith in these times of uncertainty. You are my Lord and savior and I need that today.
I am weak, quiet, and unknown.
Oh that You would establish us unto a work You have laid out beforehand. That we may walk with You in perfect peace in the adventure of life.


## 2/15/08 - 2 days left! sold the lexus!

Praise the Lord we sold the Lexus and put a deposit down on a new trooper!
So thankfully we're making progress.
I have to admit that while I'm not totally stressed, this is probably most stressful move so far. I dont' know which part it is. I think so much of the 'back and forth' and the timing where there are some gaps.
I suppose worst case scenario is that I'll have to load and unload my entire moving truck a few times by myself and that I'll have to work on my laptop at a starbucks or something. I still say it's worth it.

I just need to be reminded that the Lord is in control even in this.

_Father, I just pray these renters are from You. I don't see myself as a Landlord, at least not a long distance one! I ask that You would bless this relationship. PLease lead us to the home you have for us to live in Denver. Lead us to the property, location, setup, etc. We have no clue._

We have TWO days left here to get out. I feel we're about 70% there.



## 2/14/08

I am trying not to become overwhelmed. Nothing has been official yet. I need to recognize the while life progresses forward, it may not always be clean cut exactly how I think it should be.
I was so sure that the Lexus had been sold and that we had found a house in Denver only for both of those to back out! argh!
_Lord, I just want to ask that Your mercy is on us. We know not where to go or how to do it. I feel like we are preparing the wood, but have no power for fire. Please look on our minor and weak needs. We need to sell this car. We need to confirm our renters here. We need to find a home. We need to move in on time. we need to load up the truck. We need to find an office. Lord, in Your mercy, meet me where my faith is weak and my strength is gone._



## 2/12/08 - The whirlwind week!

It seems to all be coming together. We are headed to Colorado in probably less than 2 weeks. I just can't believe that we could be there as soon as March first! It's wild to think of all what's gone on to make this a reality.
- Not getting accepted to Vanderbilt
- Finding DU after a year long search
- My design studio concept being put on hold and then being passed to Sy. I was over it, but also was told otherwise about the project.
- With Sy moving to town to open up this office in Nashville, gave it more the reason for me not to be here. Once it was here, Jon then offered to move us to any city.
- Then to find renters for our home in 3 days
- Sold the Outback yesterday
- Lord willing, we'll sell the Lexus in the next day or two.

The final remaining detail is where we're to live. I trust the Lord and expect Him to complete what He has blessed.

> O give thanks unto the LORD, for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever. Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy, and gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south. They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.
Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted within them. Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and He delivered them out of their distresses. And He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city for habitation. Oh that men would praise the LORD for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the children of men! For He satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
Psalm 107:1-9

It's been 10 years since I first visited Denver. I have been twice since and wanted to live there. In my attempt to stay, the ground was hard and uninviting. This time the Lord is establishing us and He is King.



## 2/10 EastGate talk - rooms 101.

1. Introduction - In my perspective, you have a cookie in your hand, but I want to give you a ice cream sundae.
come to find out the cookie is apart of the sundae. In that a lessor truth gives way to a greater truth
when you know that greater truth, you will also hold the lessor
2. The eternal gospel - the purpose of earth... my version of KTF Disc 1 - track 5.
3. The 'grace escalator'
4. Glory and God in us... similar to my latest blog: http://davewoodall.blogspot.com/2008/01/glory.html
5. we are all wired by God and different. (Meyers Briggs) + our own path / history / place / current state on the journey etc
6. So what does all that mean when we gather? What is Christ in you Saying?
Ask yourself, if He gave you grace, why did he give it to you? Go out and, by faith and courage, allow Christ to express and reveal how he uniquely made you.
... which then leads into how the 'rooms' are one way to FACILITATE that.


My objective:
1. God's glory
2. Christ is in us
3. Theology

When you think of church, give me some buzz words that come to mind.

*Def* of church so we're on the same page.
501c3, col 1:24

Think of a church that you have driven by in the last week, but have never been to it, do you think you could predict 80% of what they would do if you wanted to, without stepping foot into it?
Do you have any deep friendships that are predictable and routine?
Why then do we accept it at church?
- tradition
What does it mean to be the bride of christ?


Thinking back to highschool, what was your favorite time of the day? (cafeteria, football games)
- If Christ is in you, and in me, then there is no greater spiritual place we can be. He dwells in us and gives us freedom.
- As we accepted His salvation, we need to accept His presence and existence around us. This may be where Laura and I have different opinions of the christian life. For I believe Christ came to show us to dissappear, not stand up loud up front. For His Spirit dwells in us.

Meyers - Briggs - We are all unique. Personally, This may be the most selfish reason, but I can't handle shutting my brain off, which is what I have to do when I walk into church.

Can someone give me examples of disagreements that can tear a family apart. Not even actions, but ideas and thoughts.
- But if we're the family of God, why then do issues of minor consequence tear us apart? Is it because they are that important or is it pride or not aligning with the church's status quo?


What are some of the company lines you hear of why the church gathers together?

If you had no bonds what would you do?




what is the purpose of church?
What is the purpose of grace?
What of what we do is sacred?
Where does Jesus Live? So what does that mean?
when you don't understand parts of scripture, do you think you must then be missing out?

h1. Intro

1. Definitions
* 501c3
* The Church which is his body

2. People are unique and predictable
* Meyers Briggs
* Past, Scars, Stories, and Their Journey

h1. Theology points of View

1. Christ is our Life
* His life is in us, not in a book
* Christ is in all and through all.

2. Grace is on what we stand
* The escalator theory
* There is always more grace than sin

3. The Purpose of earth
* God's glory
* Loosing ourselves

h1. Church as it should be

1. Programs are not sacred - While the bible is a valuable treasure to be had. It shouldn't be forced down our necks. It submits to us, not we to it. Christ is in us, not the bible. If you don't want to read it, don't.
But don't misunderstand me. There is tremendous wisdom and value in the Word. It is where God has placed seveal stories and helpful 'instructions' on discovering Christ in you and His plan.


2. There is more than one way to worship
* Arts, music, thought, word, & action

h1. Moving Forward

1. The day and age we live in
* Flat screen tvs can bring people together
* We can communicate with technology
* While projectors are cool, they hold no spiritual substance

2. The rooms / menu church
* If there is grace on which we stand, then we can let the body speak
* If the body is alive and passionate about knowing and growing together unto the glory of God, they can contribute to the congregation
Christ dwells in People are the life, not the programs that the professionals create. But connecting to a church is by being apart of this club. They are relying on their systems to get people into the doors instead of using the public gathering as an opportunity for the body to be fed by christ in one another.

By indirectly implying that the professionals have some sort of special priviledge you are develop those thoughts in people saying 'i'm not for the ministry'.

I've been to enough mega churches to know that you don't know or connect to anyone without being on staff, or volunteering as leadership. What does that mean for the common attendee? Who are we kidding by creating these obsure environments where people can go largely ignored. if people are coming to church, it's because they:
* need or want to know about God
* Want to connect with someone
* Looking for help
Why let those who come out of obligation continue to do so? That is not the narrow way or mentaility.

## 2/7

When someone hears of a man being a full time dad, we wonder why he's selling himself short. Men feel that man is capable of juggling multiple tasks.
Why then is it acceptable to be a full time ministry? Not that money is the issue, but it's good for man to carry the yoke in his youth. How long is he young then?
===
Father I need You today. Jesus this vessel is Your life.  I am only becoming alive by Your Spirit inside me. Would You care for Danae and her emotional needs. Would You speak softly and in love to her that she may find You to be her source of life. Would You serve her and elevate her needs above my own. Would You let her know that She is the most important person in my life.

## 2/5

"Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ" Gal 1:1
Once we stand on Grace in Christ there is a disconnect between the freedom we want or imagine, and the freedom we actually live. I find it common that people use their grace simply to cover their sins verses going out and living.

Why is it I find so few people who want to participate and engage in Life? Is it just me? Do I have a warped sense of engagement?

> "I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him, that called you into the grace of Christ, for another gospel." V. 6

I should realize then that those who do not see, while saved, have not asked to see or know the deeper things of Christ. For His imaginations are vast. His truth is overwhelming that one can't help but be floored.

What if we formed a secret society of believers. Similar to Fight club where you don't talk about it, you just find yourself living it.
We have no buildings or overt organization. We are believers who are aware of the fragile nature of man and his desire to cling to the routine even in soul issues.

Routine belongs on the assembly line. Programs belong in a school. We the church who are set free should live by the Power of Jesus Christ.

## 2/4/08

We are going to do things for eternity. This place, this detour called earth is a  place for me to discover that in all my actions, I am not the source of my power. I have no life but what God permits.

My first goal is just to get to Denver and start school this year.
I may be on the older side, but not entirely the case.

Throughout my life I have thought that I would like to try my hand at consulting. Where I would be paid to advise people in their trouble areas. I feel that's a natural component of how I'm wired.

However, I would pray for wisdom, mercy, and favor that I would not need to negatively affect my marriage if I were to pursue that. I wonder if I would be able to bring Danae on to the trips and travel necessary for a position of that sort.

> And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us, and establish Thou the work of our hands for us--yea, the work of our hands, establish Thou it. Psalm 90:17
