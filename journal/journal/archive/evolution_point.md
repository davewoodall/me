Heather﻿,

First off, you are totally welcome to join the banter anytime!
Second, I agree that where you land on origins has little to do with salvation. Evolution is a hot topic because it attempts to answer deep questions inside us all.

Evolution is the best way to try to answer
- Where did I come from?
without considering God as an option.

Further, people want to accept Evolution (and not God) because they wrestle with a another question;
- How can there be a loving God when there there is so much pain (sin), and poverty?
(This is a dichotomy to confront head on and not blow it off.)

But Evolution can't answer the third deep question, which is
- Why am I here?

So, I don't believe Evolution the point.
It's a short-sighted way to run from God because it puts mankind at the top.

I'm of the **opinion** that Evolution advocates aren't really interested in defending science. I believe they are searching for solid ground to rest on, which can be said of Christians, and all of mankind.

Ps - I actually lean to the 'earth looks old' view that Phil﻿l mentioned in the other post. If you were to look at Adam the 2nd day he was created, I figure he'd look in his teens, or twenties. Where reality, he was only 2 days new.
