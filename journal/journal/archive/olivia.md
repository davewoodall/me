An update on a variety of topics...

I have never witnessed someone yearn for another human being as much as Danae did for her daughter. I wish you could have been in the room when Danae embraced Olivia.

Until this week, I wasn't aware of the Children's hospital. But we've quickly discovered why it's ranked top in the world. Children come from surrounding states to be treated here. We are so grateful to have this outstanding facility so close to home!

Today we met with cardio and neurological doctors. They explained their areas of concern. Olivia's heart is not at a level that can function without support. She will probably need a pacemaker. Her brain MRI shows an abnormally small cerebellum which is not something that grows over time. That part of the brain is responsible for motor skills such as walking and talking. That her brain is under-developed suggests she's going to have difficulty performing these activities. Her feet and hands also have some abnormalities. This combination of heart, brain, and body are leading them to believe Olivia has a genetic disorder.

And although several specialists are working with Olivia, so far, they are unsure the root cause. Genetic Disorders are hard to diagnose and they say it could be weeks, months, or years before the know the why.

Because of the mysterious nature of all this, they suggested we discuss what we would want to do if Olivia required permanent life support. Having to add that to the mix was almost to much to handle.

In all of this, I am realizing that I have no kingdom. My peace unravels when I rattle arms against the King of Kings and demand something to be so. This NICU room is not in my dominion. I posses no power and only make life miserable when I take such a naive posture of authority. This room is apart of His Kingdom and He alone is King. My prayer is to live as a servant of his Kingdom rather than the king of mine.

We are praying for a miracle. We are praying our hearts to be aligned with His. It would mean a lot if you shared specific verses that encourage you during times like these. We love reading your notes and read every one.

But I trust in you, LORD; I say, "You are her God." Her times are in your hands.

The doctors have yet to provide additional information. They came in yesterday to reiterate how they see Olivia not surviving, or best living in near vegetable state. Over coffee I shared some of what I was thinking with Sarah and she told me to post it.

Mike Wells tells a story of the time he went to receive his wedding pictures. His photographer told him that, to develop the photos, they needed to enter a dark room. Wells then intertwines the story with life. He said the name of the dark room is 'Faith'. The first image he saw in there was negative. When he saw it, he wanted to throw it away. The photographer said 'hidden in the negative is the positive we long for'.

Before Wells could keep the positive image the photographer said there is one more step. You need to dip the positive in a vat of acid to 'set' it. Mike wondered where the acid comes from, to which the photographer replied 'it will come'.

As I heard that story, I was disappointed to think that there's another trial looming before receiving the positive completely. The pre-acid positive for me was discovering how to hear the Holy Spirit's voice. (I wrote about at dave.woodalls.me/three-parts-of-you) Olivia has set and sealed those the truths in me. So, good news is it doesn't take very much acid to set a positive. :-)

The positives that are birthed from a negative experience are with you the rest of your life so that you get to bring what you learned with you into the next trial.

We are entering the dark room again and we are staring at a negative. But this time we're doing it having seen how the Lord transforms negatives. It's as if faith is not even the right word for how we're encountering all this. It feels kind of like watching a favorite movie the second time and picking up details missed the first time. The Lord is alive and well and shows himself to those who seek him.

"I love those who love Me; And those who diligently seek Me will find Me."

I can't thank you enough for providing your stories and scripture. My life was not attuned to the amount of people who go through trials like this. But to learn we are not the first, then to be overwhelmed when reading the many verses back to back has been so nourishing.

We have been apart of a life group for the past year. What minimum we have invested into that community has paid dividends beyond imagine with the friends and assistance that have come out of this experience.

everyone for himself.

I'm in the middle of composing a thought for a new post. The crude title and concept is 'everyone for himself'
as in, if i keep my focus on Christ, then i can help others and also be filled with peace that passes understanding. If i'm trying to take care of everything and everyone, then i'm too busy and distracted.

When Christ is your focus, you have victory. But, when your problems, family, situation, or finances are your focus, then you will be undone. There is no power in you, or those things.

what's strange about all this thought, is it feels like the christian version of being the bachelor that so many men remain in. it's like, oh nice, Lord - so, if I keep my eyes on you, You'll take care of everyone else?
of course, i'm more than happy to be the man for the job. but it's a issue of 'cart before the horse'
