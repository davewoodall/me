### The basement
Derek hunched over as he stepped down so that he could see below the rafters as soon as possible. He wanted to know what made that tree glow. 

There was a light in the basement. Something was on. He got down into the room and noticed what look like a fire. he Took a closer look and decided to look.

it was hard to explain but something about that hole made him want to jump into it. Like it exuded the same feeling a spring lake would in August. 

That was no ordinary light.
