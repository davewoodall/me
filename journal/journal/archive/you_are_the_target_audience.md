# Writing for myself.

My focus is writing to sort out my own thoughts. Writing platforms like Medium are designed to make you spend your content on their platform. When I go there I find my focus on reading more so than writing. Then, it puts me into the wrong writing mentality. 

If my content is good it will be worth sharing. My focus in not to become a famous writer. I do not want to write for the reader. I want to write for myself. I need to focus on my own maturity.
