After layoffs I asked GT if I could send him some ideas from the trenches.
Books I've read on EE
- Experience Economy
- Dan Pink - Whole New Mind
- World is Flat

35 page plan - 5 sections I reviewed with Maria, Diwakar, and Kerry L before sending it to GT. 

ABOUT ME

I've been with the company almost two years. 

Currently, I'm on Marketing Platform (under Maria G.) working on Customer Service App

Before LivingSocial I spent 17 years in small business sales & marketing 
including 3 turnaround situations. 
Masters in Finance.

BREAKEVEN

Not only do I believe we can break even, 
I believe we can actually make a positive net income. 

HOWEVER, this is drastic change from how we currently do business.

It's my view the business model is too expensive to make a profit. 
we are servicing both B2B & B2C - page. 10

Daily Deals may be dead, but email is alive and well

We need to make money every time we send an email - 
regardless of the recipient's action with the email.
pg. 11.

pg. 9 - It's easier to resell a customer than to acquire a new one.

This goes to the original promise we even made to vendors.

For example, PapaMurphys

Vendors want customers who are profitable, happy, loyal

We know how to make a transaction and in the spirit of email tools, we should be offering them as a Cost Per Click, Cost Per Send, Cost Per Month model.
