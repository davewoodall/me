Don't be a mooching, fat, jerk.

I define a balanced life as one that considers 3 areas of life;
- personal (body, soul, spirit)
- relational (marriage, family, friends)
- responsibilities (work, chores, asset management)

The way that I narrowed in on these and their value is to consider someone who lacks one of those 3 circles.

### Fatty and slow;
Someone who invests in relational and responisiblities, but not themselves will lose their edge in the phystical, mental, and spiritual life

### mooch
someone who is friendly and personal but doesn't take care of their responsibilities can be a slouch

### Jerk
Someone who only focuses on their stuff and themselves does not investing in relationships and loses another key part of life.

These are extremes but used to simply say you cannot go through life without an awareness that 'single-mindedness' is not an attribute we need to strive for.n
