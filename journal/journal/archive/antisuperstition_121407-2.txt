anti-superstition (12/14/07)
============================

I believe that by beginning my day with the Lord will Establish me for
success and prosperity. This is not superstition, but a reality of the
Fact that the Lord possesses all wisdom, truth, and life. The very
ingredients of what we declare are in my ambitions of success and
prosperity.
This doesn't prevent me from the hardships and trials of Life. While
He can and does give me favor, a removal from the game would only make
me suffer. Those who are fully engaged get more out of it than the
casual participants.

>_I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that
hath no strength_ Psalm 88:4

Father, I feel this way about business and revenue. I have no idea how
to make money to provide for my family and not sell out my life. If I
were to go work some random job for money, it wouldn't last long. I've
seen the desperate measures I go to to get some relief!

>_Lord, why castest thou off my soul? Why hidest Thou Thy face from
me?_ v. 14

My feeling toward this is that He's gone into a different `room of
life'. That God doesn't want us to be comfortable sitting in a
particular routine and method of life. But He wants it new and
exciting.
_Lord, lead me to the "Room" where you dwell today. May you reveal the
life you want me to know today. For neither want another moment
wasted.
I believe you hear me and I believe your tastes are broad and deep.
You will not disappoint.
Surprise me today...

Summary:
I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. The Lord is slowly but surely
removing the cobwebs from my head. I am going to be a financial success. He
is blessing me with the necessary tools to lead multiple large projects and
investments.
Remain faithful today and find joy in the journey.
Keep to the goals set before me and remember that when God brings people
into my life for me to serve, I'm accelerating my success, not slowing it
down.
