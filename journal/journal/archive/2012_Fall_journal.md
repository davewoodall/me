Every year, Factory rents a million dollar house in Aspen, CO during the ski season. I was laughing with co-workers that this feels like a 'bro-honeymoon'.

We've already had 2 days of snowboarding, and as I write over 9" of snow hit last night. Before our last day on the mountain. It's going to be pretty incredible!


2/12/13

The part of myself that is hardest to find, is also the most real. My body and soul deceive and will die. It my spirit that was made to live forever, with Christ.

The only aspect of myself that will be forever victorious, is my Spirit, because of Him. Not because of what I say, think, feel, or do. As my body weakens, so too should my soul.

I am open to knowing what a life lived in the Spirit will do. It is indeed a battle.

I wait on the Lord and discover what I need to know on earth. Currently, I am living a rather pleasant life - learning to code, living in Boulder, caring for my family. A simple life full of relational, physical, and intellectual challenges.

I am tending digital sheep.

_11/28/12_

First day at Factory. On a scale of 1 - 10, I'd give it a 10! I am so thankful to have a season of working at that company, in that fashion. I find it so fascinating that the Lord would allow me the opportunity to continue to work in the action sports industry in the way that I am.

It means a lot in that as much as I am sporadic in my activities, I am still driving toward a consistent theme. It gives me confidence that the Lord knows what He is in fact doing!

_11/26/12_

I ended up accepting the job at Factory Labs, in Denver. I am so grateful that the Lord would allow me the opportunity to become a developer as the way to provide for my family.

I cannot wait to start! While the commute will be the longest of them all, but I am excited about what I will be learning and what I feel the Lord will be doing through the program.

I'm also excited about the idea of what the training will allow for me to accomplish, if the Lord leads me in the direction of starting another business - be it a new product (t-shirts), or service.

_11/16/12_

I have two official job offers to become a developer! With an additional 3rd offer that is supposed to hit by Monday.

This is a different type of abiding! Lord, I am waiting on You to make the decision of where You would have me. The options are between Boulder and Denver. Pros and cons of both.

Father, Thank You for this Journey. I pray that we discover whatever it is that You would have for us to learn in all of this.


_11/13_
Sitting at pivotdesk doing code. Why am I here? I love the opportunity to provide for my family while working on a computer, writing software that makes other people money. I get to learn how to code and provide for my family, until the Lord says otherwise!

I interviewed with itriage and Factory labs today. They both are open to Jr. Devs. I would be more than happy to join either one on their engineering team.

Lord, I trust you with that one!

_11/7/12_

Part 2...

Had an interview with another company today. I really like how smart the people ar who work there. I wonder if I'd be able to make the cut. Only the Lord knows.

I also had a meeting with workforce colorado unemployment and I need to keep volunteering my time at the thrift store. Well, AMEN. I look forward to looking back on this time.

Part 1.

Day after presidential Election. Obama the victor. Lord, if ever I need to keep my hope and faith in You.

I have not had work since July. Nearly 100 days now. I have had several interviews but no offers yet. As far as I can tell, I am looking to become a programmer. But only the Lord knows how and where He's going to plant us.




_11/1/12_

**Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVA is my strength and my song; He also is become my salvation.** Isaiah 12:2.

I had four interviews yesterday. I am trusting and watching with anticipation where the Lord will lead me. I look forward to seeing His plan unfold!

_10/30/12_

Just spoke with David McDaniel on our monthly call. His advice is it's time to look for any job.

I am struggling with with fighting feelings of depression and knowing that God is in control. We are walking hand in hand and He is leading me through vallies of shadows of death. But reality is He knows what and where I need to be. He knows my thoughts and the plan that I am walking is actually one Jesus has already called me to. I am thankful that I can live another day and live according to His plans and mercies.

It could be eay

_10/23/12 pt 2_

It's 9:20 pm. I worked from 4:30 am - 9:20 pm. Subtract commute and breaks and I worked nearly 16 hours on learning to program. I need not stress, worry, or doubt. The Lord is in control! He knows where, when, how, and why.

Father, I'd love to learn this, but I'm also completely open to whatever You are calling and preparing me for. I am a bit tired and overwhelmed at what I should be doing with my time. I am thankful for my wife and sons.

I can't help but frame myself as a 35 year old at the bottom and so far removed from any level of success. But let me be reminded that You oh Lord are my provider, sustainer, shepard, guide, father, friend, and companion.

I need not fret because you are with me.

_10/23/12_

This is the day the Lord has made!

I sold AMB3R nearly 90 days ago and we moved to Boulder about 60 days ago.

I found out yesterday that Mike Low is quiting amb3r at the end of the month. It hasn't been 90 days and the news of that company is not that good. I am surprised that it happened so quickly, but then again, I'm not. That company was held together by the Lord, by a thread. I will be very curious to see how it turns out in the next 90 days.

I had some encouraging experiences programming yesterday. I was pairing with Lew at Pivotal. He is a client of theirs and made some comments that I was following along well. Then, I went to a hack meet to discuss TDD and found that I had a good grasp of what was being covered at the most basic levels.

I am so grateful for the Lord who has sustained us in so many different and unique ways. I left Ouray a year ago. He has kept us safe and secure in one way or another. We have lived in Atlanta, Chicagao, Michigan, Florida, and now back go Colorado. I know for sure He led us here. I am excited and anticipating the way in which He will provide, as He already does.

**Thou shalt guide me with THy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.** Psalm 73:24


_10/22/12_

The notion of explaining to people that there is One God seems pretty obvious. That we could reason a sole Creator. One God to rule them all. But the part of there being one Way to God, through Jesus is not something that has become fully clear to me yet. How do I share that one? It feels like my argument currently is "Because I said so... or because the Bible says so." People then are left to determining if their faith and beliefs are based on the distribution and success of the bible and it's readers. I'm not doubting that Jesus is the way, I just don't know how to share it with others.

But I think the Lord just gave me some insight into this.

Heaven is pefect and so are it's inhibitants. God cast out the angels who sinned once. Nothing in heaven is flawed. We need to acheive that state of perfection, yet we are all sinners. In order to meet that, we need to have our sins removed to be justified. To become perfect. That is where Christ came to bring us into eternity. Nothing we can do is by our own power. It is the power of God that saves us. That brought us into eternity. And it is by the power of God that we are sustained and He is glorified.

We are on this earth because of the contrast we can see the difference between who we are and who God is. To have an environment, a refining stage to discover that God is mighty, filled with Power. He sustains us even when the world says no. Even though I have no job, God is holding us together.

I am trusting as the Lord leads me on this journey to become a programmer. There is so much to learn and while I am slowly comprehending it - it feels so far off at times.

Today I start a semi-interview with one of Pivotal's clients. The company is Anthem and they are some non-profit. Lou, their developer, asked if I'd want to help out - based on a few days of pairing. We'll see how it goes. I am thankful for what the Lord is doing and how He is leading us on a wild adventure!

_10/19/12_

I woke up at 3:30am but laid in bed for 30 minutes reading drudge, twitter, and facebook. So very rare that any of those things produce knowledege or understanding. Certainly no wisdom!

But then, I feel a sense of urgency in time. That I need to rush to the job and focus on learning to program. No time to spend on a quiet time.

Father, what would it mean to hand over my efforts of a quiet time over to You.For me to be the recipient of a relationship where I respond to the knowledge, wisdom, life, and love that only You provide.

I am still at a sterile life. Not to put a pity party on me but I have had the occasional fling of performance but for the most part I'm living in iscolation.
I think this observation is both confusing and what is driving me to Christ. I can't tell if this is part of the journey to live a broad life and not shoot up too quickly. I recall that as a prayer and I wonder if that's what has been happening. If so, I am definiately curious what I am being prepared for.

In one way, the things I crave could be solved by success. In another way, success would bring a whole new set of trials and pain. I miss my family and friends and I wish I could see them. I also would like for Danae and I to go to the dentist.

I still think that's why I enjoy learning to program. Something I can work on and toward in the quiet of my room.

**What is the point of abiding?**

The trees I eat of:
- Tree of knowledge of good and evil
- Tree of adam - mind, will emotions
- Tree of Life - Christ, the only living tree.


_10/16/12_

There are so many things that could cause me duress and anxiety. The topics of the government, federal spending, and the national debt are big enough that they can affect my peace. I begin to imagine trying to survive and protect my family based on a lack of proper skills and no means to provide for my family during economic collapse.

But in this too can I abide. For the Lord is my defense. He keeps His angels charge over me. He knows what aspects and experiences in this world will prepare me for the next.

I can abide in You, Lord. I do not need to think, feel, or do anything about the government - beyond what You call me to do.

**Trust in Him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before Him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.** Psalm 62:8

**I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in His word do I hope.** Psalm 130:5

35 years old now. In a way, it's the last year of my 'youth'. All years leading up to this were lived in the moment of adventure and excitement. But I have yet to experience any level of influence or success. I don't know if that is part of preparation or my story. Is my way of knowing of God one in which I have to accept the tension of desire to be a leader. For again, I am isolated from any active ministry, company, or friends.

Programming seems so appealing because I can do a lot of it without much human interaction. I like it as a way to learn, build, and potentially provide an income for my family. But I know deep down that these things are temporary, which is why I struggle with continued lack of impact.

I don't know if this is preparation, or my story. Thank You Lord that I can abide in You in all things. You are alive and well and know who I am and why You made me.

_10/15/12_

My soul is dead. I have no choice but to come to the Lord, and wait and watch as He, only, restores my soul.

**He restores my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.** Ps. 23:3

The only seeming power this earth has is that it came first. Without context, it looks like this world is the only one. But this is the gestation period. The place in time that our hearts are revealed. Where Christ is forming in us His life and nature that we might know who are and the uniqueness of how we were created.

Jesus went to hell to set the captives free. Isn't it possible that he could do that again in say, 10 million years?

I have gone through the questions of asking if learning to program is the best thing I should do with my time. After all, there are people starving in Africa, people going to hell, and all kinds of other social injustices that are happening. Wouldn't my time be better served saving other people?

Then I mix those thoughts in with the notion of the way that I'm wired and if I could even become a programmer. There is so much to learn and am I too old to start.

But neither my age or the world's needs are what I should listen to. The Lord is doing some great and mighty things in and through me. Sitting down and working on a computer is something I enjoy but seems also to be at the speed that I find a daily need for the Lord and a way to abide. I am silencing my aspirations to be great and focusing on learning the tasks at hand. Where these experiences end up taking me are already ordained by the Lord.

Even more, the world of big factories and lots of employees is not the business models that are competitive anymore. It is the companies who are meeting people's needs online. What better business training that to learn to program!




_10/11/12_

Yesterday I realized I was exerting the tiniest bit of effort come in my pursuit of the Lord, in the form of giving Him my attention. In doing so, I found myself in full awareness and focus on Him, but also I was disappointed when I realized how long it had been since I had my attention on the Lord.

Then, in that moment I realized a few things; First, because it was unsuccessful I realized it was my soul trying to do things. Then, I also realized that the power of abiding is resting with Christ. As I detach and bury all my soul's initial efforts in exchange for Christ to live His life through me - we will have our minds go wherever they need to go.

**Thou shalt guide me with Thy counsel, (life & Spirit!), and afterward receive me to glory** Psalm 73:24


_10/10_

There's no half abiding. Either I am completely removed of striving in my soul, or it creeps in deceptively and I fall into the trap of personal striving.

I want my hope to be in Christ alone. For His power is all I need. I want to help out Scott Whitaker but I can't seem to grasp his views on life yet. It feels like he wants to strive in the Lord, rather than abide. I think his intentions are good, just that he's still trying to add value.

**But thou, O Lord art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.** Ps. 3:3

If I stop and think about the last month. Even though I haven't had a job I have to admit that it has been one of the most peaceful times of life in a long time. Even more so, there have been minimal disagreements with Danae. I attribute all this to the Lord and abiding with Him. To remain at the center, not dwelling or operating in my soul. But following the leading and promptings of the Spirit.

**Delight thyself also in the LORD; and He shall give thee the desires of thing heart. Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in Him; and he shall bring it to pass** Ps 37:4,5

These verses make my heart jump. That I could come to You and be fulfilled. That my needs and wants could be met. But it's also the other thought that I don't really know what is good, or even best.

My initial thought is _Lord, teach me to be a programmer!_ But I do not know what or where You are leading. I am thankful that You want to give me the desires of my heart. I think though, that my desire is that I might continually and forever abide with You. That I might remain in the Spirit and keep my awareness and attention on You, in all ways.

The US Presidential debate was on last night - Romney vs. Obama. The view so far is that Romney won. I enjoyed watching and tweeting about it.

My desire is to begin to remove both politics and social media from my life. They are both noise and have little to no impact on what I am currently involved in.

_Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear._ Isaiah 59:1

I confess that I'm distracted right now. I met Ben Atkin yesterday and we discussed working together to get some freelance business. He seems to be very skilled. We met for a few hours to see how we might be able to work together. The next step was for me to reach out to some of my leads, including Barry who is starting a snowboard company. He emailed me back that he's not sure I have the talent to do so. So, I've been thinking this morning what and how I should respond.

But I don't want to act that way. I want to abide as I know that the LORD is my shepherd and provider. I really look forward to the day that I live with completely conviction of that truth.

_Father, as I am confronted with a work lead may I bury my flesh and abide with You and Your Holy Spirit._


**The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.**

- My stomach wants
- My family wants
- My wife wants
- My landlord wants
- My car wants

The tension is great in these two worlds. The one I live in is the temporary one. The one that is eternal is distant in sight so that the surrounding peers choose to ignore or defy You.

I would summarize my life so far as one who wants to know God, but doesn't know what I am to do on this earth. I have been bound and tied to difficulties with income and influence. From the outside it looks like I repeatedly commit career suicide.

_He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake._ Ps 23:3

_Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever._ v6
I love that verse. As one who has nothing to offer and feels so inadequate for time and contribution. I feel like I experience life in a way that I do not deserve. Because of Thy mercy.

David, You are my precious son. I have called you to many great things. You need not be anxious. I love You and care for You. We have a special relationship. I know you and put you in this day and place. I uniquely crafted you to love life and my creation. You need to hear these words from me. I am Your life. I know what You know and need. I love your family and friends. TRUST ME.

You want to talk about Coding? I love it. I support your desire and ambition to learn. I will lead you in this new path. I like Ben. Pray for Him. I don't need money. You don't need a job when You have me.

May I go where you lead today, Lord. May You go with me wherever I go.


_10/3_

The Lord is my Shepard, I shall not want. He chose me, I didn't choose Him.

9:00 am sitting at a shop next to pivotal, called Dojo. They have Wednesday morning code & coffee. It's my first time.

Lord, I do not want to lead my life. I do not want to pretend that I know anything. I cannot live unto life. You alone are the Life.

_10/2_

In order to get fully immersed into developing, I want to use all the tools of the trade. Which means I'm going to stop using Evernote and journal in this for a while.


9/5

I find myself wondering what I've been doing with my time. What Have I learned of value over these years. I think that in preparing myself for something, I've discovered that I have nothing to offer. I think I've been spending time on being a leader, learning finances, management, design, and business.

I am not seeking to put value in those things, but I simply scratch my head in wonder - what have I been doing?

I am thankful to have discovered Christ and the power of abiding in and with Him. I am thankful to have discovered the vanity of my soul.

"I can bring beauty out of the ashes of lost dreams" - Jesus

*Jesus, I want what You want to give me. I want to know You.*

**Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus** - Rom 3:24

My story seems to be one where I simultaneously wanted to play and have no responsibilities for as long as possible. I then wanted to learn what I needed to learn to be prepared as a man and a leader. Reading books, listening to sermons, attending conferences. All in the aspiration to be ready for the day I would do something of purpose. Then, I align that with this truth that I am set free. I submitted myself to God but then God as a man who wanted to serve. But I can see now that I still had a lot of internal work to be done on me. For I thought I could take on a good mission myself. For four years I pushed hard and fought to keep a balanced perspective on everything. As it ended in flames, I now find myself 35, unemployed, and seeking jobs that pay nothing, or minimal at best. I find it hard not to laugh at this. I am spending my time learning to program. Is that what I am to be doing? I have no idea what kind of job I can do. Should I go to a temp agency?

I think I'm hurt that all my 'friends' along the way have either fallen off, or don't help. I think of shawn mahan, mark baas, jimmy kline, jimmy wall, hayes trotter, aaron peterson, pete stogner, tim russo. I took great pride in investing in these guys, offering my time, interest, and service. I have had a lot of fun with these guys along the years but for some reason, I want to define 'value' as they help me with my career. That they too would say;

**"Hey Dave, we have a need and I think you would be perfect for it." **

Why has that never really happened?

People who are noise in twitter;
- billionaires like - cuban, trump
- politicians - romney
- customers

Code dave, I like what you're doing. I like what you're working on. I've blessed it. I am walking with you. Keep in mind that I am Your savior. The one who set you free. There is no other. I am the one who loves you. I keep You safe and near to me. All of these books and journals have their place in my shaping and revealing Myself in you. Don't be too hard on your friends. They are lost too. It's all part of the journey. Keep your faith and hope in me. I bought you with My own life. I, of course know who you are and what you're doing. Don't be anxious. Don't worry. There are many things out there that you need to learn and I am going to teach them to you. Come deeper into your spirit. Discover that there is much more in store for you, my son. How about we turn off Twitter for a season. Nothing is really there… Keep working at Rails, Ruby, pairing, text mate, unix, testing, and loving your family. They are the ones that will be with you when all your friends and coworkers have left. I am with you and I will do it through you, all you have to do is abide and obey. (I want to obey, Jesus.) Don't let your heart be troubled because you are misreading a peaceful time of life. There is plenty of work to be done - temporal, and eternal. Meet with me in the mornings. Meet with me in the day. You have nothing to worry about. I love Danae and your boys. They are treasures.

Hello Oscar. My name is Dada.

9/4

There is a rattling in the trooper as we drive. It's the kind of noise that would drive me crazy in both my thoughts and feelings. But now, it's driving me to Christ - and I am thankful for that noise! _I love being with You, Lord._ I love the things that You use to work things out for good. My soul is dead - mind, will, and emotions - have all betrayed me for the last time.

"And they say, How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the most High?" ps 73:11

Just because someone is advancing in a career, finances, or business doesn't mean they have succeeded in true life. For this life is momentary, fragile, and nothing here can be taken when we die. Living in the moment is the soul's best answer to what it can console us with. But as the soul eventual reveals it's powerlessness - all things other than Christ prove meaningless and empty.



9/3
4:00 am - Memorial Day.
I am endeavoring on a hard journey in that I am 35 and aspiring to become a software developer for a job. There are times when I feel that I grasp the trade, then other days I wonder where this is leading.
Mike Wells talks about needing to be in ministry because that's the place that he gets the most cuts of his key. I can say that is how I feel currently about programming. I both love it and need the Lord because I am constantly in over my head. I am going to block out the thoughts that a computer is a meaningless tool to learn. I am waiting on the Lord to lead me in the way He wants me to go. _Lord, my life is not my own. You can keep me for whatever tasks You want of me._
