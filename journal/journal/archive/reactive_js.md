# Reactive JS Review

## Background
Quick context about me to know if I may or not be your target audience. I've been coding for about 5 years and think of myself intermediate at JS. At work, I'm considered a 'full stack front-end developer'. So, my focus has been to know core Javascript well enough to use Angular on Rails. I've put some time into underscore and have an intermediate level understanding of JQuery. And while we use JQuery, my professional experience has come onto the scene where we want to use a framework instead of _JQuery wild west_. After reading the first four chapters of Reactive JS (RJS) I'm really curious to know how these improve the problems with promises and async code. 

## Purpose & Practicality
I didn't know about Reactive JS but I totally get it from the spreadsheet analogy. I think that was great way to explain how it works but it did not convince me or provide context to understand why I would use it for a web app, unless I'm rebuilding a google spreadsheet. I don't have enough promises in my code, but maybe that's because I don't know how to use them? So, that lead me to a list of questions;

- What can I use of this library? 
- Where does it fit into my stack? 
- What size tool is this? 
- Will I use it with Angular the way I use underscore? Or, is this something I have to choose between. 
- I'd also like to know what kind of app size this will begin to be used. 
- Is there a lot of setup or can I use this out of the gate? 
- Lastly, after I read the book, will I be able to easily implement these lessons into existing code if I want to?

## Code samples
I recognize the initial code samples were just examples but they were arbitrary so I didn't see how to apply them to anything I'm currently working on. I would have liked to have some _"Oh cool, I can see how that would make my life easier."_ But since they weren't very relevant I began losing incentive to continue reading. I had to psyche myself up that I had this review deadline, or otherwise, if it were a random PDF - I would have shelved it for _"OK, I'll read that later when I know when and why"_. Again, maybe I'm not the target audience here and I think that's a completely valid response.

## General

_Chapter 1:_

First diagram is interesting but I don't fully understand it. It would be nice to either have some further explanation about it, or just remove it if it's unnecessary.

_Small:_ The observer pattern example, at first I didn't realize you were naming your observer variable, `listener`, I think you should name the variable `my_observer` so I quickly see that it's an arbitrary name at that point.

_Chapter 2:_

I like the overview and explaining the building blocks. However, I found the chapter more valuable after I had some context of chapter 4 and then went back to it. Maybe it's because it's so technical that I'm not sure I'm ready to commit to those details until I see a payoff, which came from chapter 4.

_Chapter 3:_

Love the marble diagrams! Makes me want to read more code books with similar diagrams of work flow. (I'm a visual learner.) Again, I really liked this chapter but enjoyed it more once I saw the bigger use case application in chapter 4.

_Chapter 4:_

Love the idea of building a video game. I would like to rebuild but it would also be cool if that source code is on github so I can download and tinker with it.
