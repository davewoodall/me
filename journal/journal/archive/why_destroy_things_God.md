Again, this is new territory for me but before these past 6 months I didn't really understand why / how the world was so evil that God would flood it, create foreign languages at Babel, destroy Sodom & Gomora, call Israel to wipe out civilizations and more. I just assumed that God had a really mean (or sensitive) side that I didn't understand. But now I see it that there is an extreme onslaught of evil and itâ€™s coming back to create a one world currency, religion, and government - and that those things are happening right in front of us.  My world view has completely changed from that stuff is nice bible stories, to seeing it actually in motion.
