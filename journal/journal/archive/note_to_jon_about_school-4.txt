Note to Jon about School
========================

Hey Jon,

2008 has so far gone down as one wild year. I would never have
imagined any of these new experiences. In the midst of all this
transition with work and preparation for a baby I’ve been doing a lot
of thinking and searching about the the future and what I need to do
to continue to grow. As you know, I have been one lover of learning
and continual improvement. I think I read 20 books or so last year. In
addition I found the Accounting class to be extremely helpful to
improve in my weakness of finance.

I trust Scott is bringing great things to play with Futura. The
development and implementation of needed policy is bringing some
helpful clarity for sure. While Futura is going through a transition
stage, I feel that this is a good time for me to pursue my MBA with a
focus on Marketing and Finance. Afterwards we both could come out
stronger and better able to meet the challenges ahead.

Last week I accepted a program here in Denver that begins in
September. I had taken the GMAT in anticipation of working at the
Franklin Office after the anticipated Uth Stuph merger and pursing my
MBA at night at Belmont. Since I had taken the GMAT the application
process was quick and easy.

I would like to continue to work with Futura and maintain my accounts
while in school. I also hope to bring my educational experience to
work and continue to build on the long term strategies.

Dave
