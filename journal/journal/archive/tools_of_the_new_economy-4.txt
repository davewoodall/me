Tools of the new Economy
========================

_12/10/07_

In this information age, There are tools, such as basecamp and
backpack that enable the user to accomplish so much more than the
previous man.
These tools and technologies will give one man the advantage over the
other while they are not common place.
I have this opportunity to gain ground being on the front end of
innovation while most men will only become aware of these things when
it becomes a requirement for survival.
