Dear family,

I started this email out on January 28th in response to the love and support of you all, fully intending to send it out. It didn’t happen that way but I hope you know how grateful I am for you.

It means a lot to see you all take time out and acknowledge Olivia. It’s difficult to put into words what this year has done for us as a family and individuals. But one thing I recognized this year was how grateful I am for all of you. And though we don’t talk on a regular basis, it is not out of lack of love or desire to connect with you. In fact, I envisioned a different story when we moved to Colorado nearly 7 years ago. I figured Colorado would be the I begin experiencing success and have the kind of margin to travel home regularly.

One of the significant changes in my life is the reality of mortality. Gone are my casual assumptions that I will have an indefinite amount of time to pursue my plans. And further, the concept of plans has begun to unravel as well. I recently described to Danae that we’re in sort of a spiritual hospital. While we have visions of returning to a normal life but we need to take the time to heal.

As I reflect on each one of you;
