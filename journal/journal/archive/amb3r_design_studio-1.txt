AMB3R design studio
===================

I can't seem to shake this design studio concept. I feel as I see an
opportunity in the market to bring a new approach to apparel design.
Specifically it would be tees and hoodies. For every 100 tee and
hoodie orders there are some others that just waste time. I suppose I
should consider custom head wear next.

I'm thinking that we need one shop to start. One to show that we are
on to something. I see it becoming the starbucks of apparel. a place
people want to go and experience our service. Where they feel like the
designer and center of attention.

I have simplified my idea from original - down to four primary
stations:
1. intro - learn what we do, how we do it, and step one.
2. Samples - our menu of services in real time
3. Design lab - they can work on their product
4. production (checkout) - place their order / check on status

This concept I feel is based on `casual consulting' a term I feel
helps us in a `local' market of the US where we are not as prone to
competing solely on price.

I'm thinking that I would try to launch it next July, 2009 if we can
get some substantial sales this year during school.

I am going to lean heavily on Jeremy to learn and work for AMB3R to
succeed.
