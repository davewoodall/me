Hello friends. 

I've been over in #lets-start-a-business and i need a fresh pair of eyes because I don't want to fall prey to _group think_. In that channel, my idea was to pitch Jason Fried to let `we the LS` take over backpackit.com since it's retired. I spent the past week writing about 60 pages of notes and emailed him [this letter]()

Needless to say, the product is now my head. Meaning I feel like I just did a massive deep dive into a product that just dropped it's customers. The product wasn't bad. The team just quit and put a working SAAS model, that I have used for 7 years, into retirement. It's fitting that we all hear of the pinboard(guy) v. IFFTT($30M FUNDED). Now I have a few months with nothing to do but wait out my severance (45 days-ish). So, I'm just a guy with 45 days on my hands. 

BTW - i read up on pinboard and I love that guys life. I want to live that. Or Instapaper's story. Or hell, even @DHHs life! A little about me, If I was able to code 50% b/c I make $150,000 year working 1,500 hour a year, then I'd spend the other 500 hours writting a fiction novel about a kid set in the 1980's who convinces his library to apply for the only computer in the state, and they win it. Well, I would be able to explain the motives behind him wanting a computer. And what he would do with it, which are two very different reasons. The protagonist walks by the cities horse track and spots a drunk stumble out of a horse track. The man clearly won that day. _The pro_ asks - how did you win? The drunk replies what the boy built on the computer. I guess it kinda feels like an autobiography of sorts...

I feel like there can't be a better time to try out a side product since it wouldn't make money and violate my contract. Because there would be 6 months free trial. But I need to code to keep my skills sharp. So, here's what I'm thinking -  If Jason doesn't hire me as ceo of backpack, then Iâ€™m going to try to build my own, modern, mobile first version. (I need @eldar, @shawn.russel, @jared). Josh Fabian was my room mate when I attended code academy in chicago - before it got run by @dhh and converted it into starterleague.com (Which is just an amazing title. He didn't even call those people JR's. HAHAHA. I could @dhh say _Uh Niel... you guys are more like a league of starters in his thick THOR accent._ ) :thor:

If you don't remember what backpack is, [view it from 2013](http://web.archive.org/web/20110303222843/http://backpackit.com/?source=tada-bp) because they shut it down 2 years ago! So nobody sees us anymore. Backpack was not evernote(FUNDED and in trouble), or one note(microsoft s.u.x.), or google keep(... should i say google?), it was the idea that paper.dropbox.com(my bad, the bay areas guys who turned down apple) is kind of trying to imitate. But BP has been around since 2005. There are still some unimplemented idea meat on that bone. (Which is what I will do if I get hired as CEO of backpack.) So, what I'm saying, is... there's gold in them there hills. (I hope they are in the blue ridge mtns.)

I'd love some help if you're interested, which at minimum keeps your skills sharp, working with friends, and listening to `def.leopard`. 

PRIVATE

1. how would you like to help?
2. how much do you want to help?

I'll compile a spreadsheet and this will influence how we split equity *see note

PUBLIC 

[screenshot]()
[But equity is a private matter. see footnote](https://twitter.com/wwwoodall/status/715001157047816192)

Compensation will be the same for every founder, $100 an hour, owed to you by the company when it generates revenues. (We split revenues up to $200 hr, based on every founder.)

_This is the start of us being in business for ourselves. We have everything we need right here._

EQUITY

Whoever pays $9 gets that % of ownership at the end of 45 days. In theory, 10,000 hours only requires... _27 people._ :-) So we can say on `/about` that we work remote and were profitable from the first month at 27 x $9 = $243. :-D 27 of 198 people is 13% of the FHR community. 

** remember, everyone also gets a free 6 month period just for signing up! which gives you a chance to see what a product that has 324,000 hours invested! **

COST

Everyone will pay $9. a Month if you plan to help you. There's a 90 day grace period on skipping payments. after 90 days, your equity is dilluted to the remaining $9 paying monthly members. By paying we all invest equally and divest as such. It is also the way to keep our work honest as remote workers. Kind of a _Trust but verify_ kind of thing. I'm sorry but that's the only way to ensure we're headed in the right direction.

LEGAL
  
You need to use your personal laptop if you want to help.

PITCH 

I've loved working with you all and we all say that. I'd love to keep this team alive as big as possible. What if we work on a product together. 
45 days x 100 people * 6 hours = 54,000 hours.

*I bet we can build this in 10,000 hours.*

_private:_ I'd love your _honest_ opinion via DM.

_public:_ Is it Do you like it enough to pay for it? Why not?
:thumbs_up: :thumbs_down: :maybe: (or, _other_ in #lets-start-a-business)

OUTSIDE INVESTORS
must be approved by (2/3) majority. (Or more?)
must abide by our terms of service as defined by ???

Does this make sense?
