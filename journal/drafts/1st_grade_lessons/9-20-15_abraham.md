## COIN GAME

## Abraham

Genesis 15:4–5
Genesis 15:6

### Reason
People would forget about God if God didn't find someone to help!

### Reward (you will be blessed)
“I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you;
I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.[a]

### Risk 
Abraham didn't have any children so how could he become a great nation?

### Rely on
God and what God taught him.
"Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward." 15:1
"Abram believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness." - Genesis 15:6

Proverbs 16:9 reads, "In their hearts humans plan their course, but the LORD establishes their steps.” Though we often try, we cannot bring about God’s will. We can only wait on the LORD and, like Abraham, be obedient.
