Our part of The Big God Story begins with the Israelites in the wilderness near a mountain called Mount Sinai. The last time we were together, we heard how God put Joseph in charge of Egypt to save many people from a famine. All of Joseph’s family—the Israelites—moved to Egypt. After the Israelites lived in Egypt for a while, they started having so many children that the Egyptians got worried they would take over the country. So the Egyptians made them into slaves. Hundreds of years later, God miraculously delivered His people. God chose a leader named Moses to bring His people out of Egypt and lead them through a wilderness into a new land, a Promised Land, where they would be free to worship Him only.

After God freed His people from slavery in Egypt, He took them into the wilderness and gave them the Ten Commandments to guide them as His people. Though God gave His people everything they needed to worship Him, the Israelites often responded with fear and uncertainty. They also chose to worship false gods. This made the Lord sad, but He forgave them when they told Him they were sorry. God kept showing them that He is enough.

God was enough for the Israelites, but wandering in the wilderness, they continually reminded Moses that they longed to return to Egypt because it was familiar. They knew what to expect. And once again, at Mount Sinai, the Israelites fell prey to their desire for the familiar.

The mountain glowed with the fire of God, and the people were filled with wonder, awe, and excitement as they watched their leader climb to the top of it. However, as time passed, their excitement turned to fear. In their lack of faith they turned to worship a false god they’d seen in Egypt: Apis, symbolized by a golden calf. Apis was the Egyptian god of nature. Though the Israelites had seen God separate bodies of water, send manna to the earth, and lead a nation by cloud and fire, they chose to worship a deity they could feel and touch. And to this idol they brought the same burnt offerings and peace offerings they had offered Yahweh when He gave them the covenant at Mount Sinai (Exodus 24).

The feeling of uncertainty while wandering in the wilderness may have compelled the Israelites to choose a “safe,” comfortable alternative—a false god who wouldn’t (and couldn’t) devour leaders by means of fire, demand total obedience, or require committed worship. In doing this, they lost track of the fact that their God was real and mighty—and had already provided so much more. They lost track of the fact that the one true God who demanded their trust and dependence would transform them into people set apart for Him.

## Israel’s Compromise
Moses’ brother, Aaron, told the people to bring him their gold jewelry so he could use it to make an image of a golden calf. After making the calf, the people said, “‘These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt. ’When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, ‘Tomorrow there will be a festival to the LORD’” (Exodus 32:4–5). This shows that the people felt uncomfortable with the invisible nature of the one true God and preferred a physical manifestation they could worship, even though God had expressly forbidden them to make one.

When Moses came down the mountain, he was furious at what they had done! Invite the children to make a “furious” face. In fact, he was so angry that he threw down the tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written, and they broke into pieces! How do you think God felt about what the people had done? Allow answers. Yes, He was angry with the people, too! God knew that an idol could never be enough for His people. Only God is enough. God was angry, but He is also gracious and loving. God forgave His people after Moses begged for forgiveness on their behalf. Then God used Moses to rewrite the Ten Commandments on new stone tablets, and the Israelites agreed to obey.

God did so much for the Israelites. He brought them out of their old life in Egypt. He was preparing them for life in the Promised Land where they would live set apart for Him so they could show the world what a relationship with the one true God was like. God gave the Israelites everything they needed—He is enough! Invite the children to turn to a neighbor and say “God is enough!”

But just like the Israelites, we sometimes have trouble believing that God is enough for us too. Sometimes we choose to rely on the things the world offers instead of trusting God to provide everything we need. We can easily start to trust in other people, money, or things so much that we give too much attention to them, instead of God. But only God can truly fill the need in our hearts for love. Only God can show us the purpose for our lives. And only God can forgive us when we sin and help us get back on track. God is enough! Say that with me. God is enough! Children join in the shouting. Next week, we’ll hear more about how God provided for the Israelites in the wilderness and continued to show them that He is enough! Tell a story of a time when God showed you that He is enough.

REMEMBER VERSE
“Let the one who boasts boast about this: that they have the understanding to know me, that I am the LORD, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight,” declares the LORD. Jeremiah 9:24
