# Reinvent the wheel.

We talk alot about apprenticeships. But not many of us can get them. But what is the point of an apprenticeship? To see exactly how the pros do things. Because after all, we don't know how things work.

## Here's a day in the life of an apprentice;
- do mundane boring tasks (your day job)
- watch the master do his job (copy source code)
- practice (build something and teach what you learn)




## overview
- this is a learning model (this is not bound to just uS.)
- hands on
- see what's normal (get context)
- ways to get some code mileage by playing cover songs
- tests are the teachers
- tinker with tools - console.
- low pressure learning
- low motivation b/c you're not thinking.
- it's okay to copy.
- you'll learn by exposure
- gets into good habits - TDD
- get some commits
- get some help with open source (2 PR's so far)

## why underscore
- tools for common tasks
- know these methods for what you can do on, to data
- learn what kinds of situations need to be supported to make a library work
- it's small
