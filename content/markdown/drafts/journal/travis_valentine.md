I haven't shared much of my experiences over the past two years.

- February 10 2014; Olivia passed away 2 weeks after she was born.
- April 10, 2016; Courage, my 11 month old son drown.

Mortality, eternity, and life after death became very real for me and those experiences have forever changed me.

I'm available to listen to anyone having such thoughts or questions after hearing the news of Travis.
