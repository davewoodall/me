# convergence

I have more reasons to write than not to. Personal, relational, and professional. Personally, I enjoy thinking by writing. Relationally, I want to say things to my sons for the days I can teach them. Professionally, Iâ€™m not realizing that my content makes for good practice of my coding. The convergence is energizing.
