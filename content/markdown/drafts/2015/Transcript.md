Olivia's due date was supposed to be today. However, that is not the case.
Transcript from Olivia's Funeral
(Song to be played while reading...)
I like to think that this song portrays Olivia's first 100 steps in heaven. Hearing birds for the first time. Walking for the first time in a garden as morning fog begins to dissipate. I can't wait to take that walk myself... Meeting and experiencing all this love and support and attention is beyond words. I am going to speak candidly about what we experienced. He prepared us for this path. He taught us to recognize his voice over the past 2 years. We learned the difference between the soul and the spirit. How the soul is all our activity - thinking, feeling, and doing. But the spirit is a temple to meet with God. My general observation of people who are walking alongside us are trying to imagine what it would be like for us. Those imaginations are soul related activity - wondering how we're feeling, thinking, or doing. We are not living from the soul. If we were then we would be a wreck, too. Just as the lungs weren't made for water, our souls can't handle darkness. Feelings, thoughts, and will are are undone here. In your spirit, you realize you are not alone. There we meet with the Lord. The Holy Spirit can handle this and gladly becomes our eyes, ears, and guide. The Spirit sounds like is your voice so it's odd because you are in a posture of listening and it takes some time getting used to it. Usually the first thing you'll hear is "I love you."Our innate desires for comfort and safety avoid darkness. But He encouraged me by saying that In the darkest places are hidden the most precious of treasures. He again encouraged me by framing the temporal nature of what we're going through. That just because I can look at the sun during a sunset doesn't mean that the sun is tame. And that though these days seem dark, doesn't mean they are. We are living moment by moment and find the peace and strength when we remain with him. I just want to remind you that all things work together for good and this is no exception. Thank you again for all your love and support.


# It's not what it looks like

## Just because these surroundings appear dark, doesn't mean they are.
God spoke to me and put this into perspective. He said just because I can look at the sun during a sunset doesn't mean the sun is tame. And just because these surroundings appear dark, doesn't mean they are. The truth is Jesus is alive and well in what looks like negative times. But soon enough, this will turn positive and we will all rejoice together.
