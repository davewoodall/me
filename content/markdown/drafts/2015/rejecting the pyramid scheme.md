# Rejecting the pyramid scheme
Olivia passed away a year ago today. It's a strange experience to stand on the soil of the cemetery where you've buried a child. Life after p a death has taken me down some interesting thoughts about…everything. It has a way of removing the perception of infinite life on this side of eternity.

I used to live like I would live forever. Why not? I had strength and desire. But as those begin to run out I'm ready to receive a p different message. When my presumption of infinite life died, so did other views that were based on it. It's most clear to me when I p compare what I believed at 27, 17, and 7 to 37. Each previous decade held a simpler and safer view of life. Almost sheltered. But I'm beginning to notice a common theme between my life's seemingly random events: A call to reject the kingdoms that war against God's kingdom.

Recently I watched a clip that suggested the Illuminati created the monetary system. 'Illuminati', as in the group of people controlled by p the devil for the devil’s long term plan described in Revelation: One-world religion, One-world government, the anti-christ, 666, and other p prophesies Christians typically believe in. Topics that I would generally agree with but never had interest or time to explore logistics. Up until this year those were fringe topics I had zero interest in.

But regardless of the inspiration, ever since I heard that the money system is not of God I have begun thinking through what it would mean p to reject my acceptance of the entire establishment that rules our life and thoughts. Can I live with it the same way I live with gay marriage and abortion? As in, part of this world but not choices I agree with.

I live like I need money to survive. But is that true? If money is a world system, then I’m going to pray about what it means to refrain p from serving it. I’m not talking about racking up credit card debt and stopping paying rent. But living in the truth that God meets all my p needs. It sounds like a BIG, crazy idea to talk about rejecting material systems that make me feel comfortable. It’s a big paradigm shift but it’s also amazing how much more of God I seeing when I remove my kingdom and the world's kingdoms from my focus.

No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. Matthew 6:24

I like all of this. Good and interesting things to think about, if I can ever make time from trying to make it in the world.

Brother, Steve
Yes, Steve. I was the same. But all living things have the same cycle: born, thrive, die. I recognize I've entered the death stage sooner than most of my friends. One day you will enter into the dying stage and you will see how hollow it is at the top of the pyramid.

But I agree the world holds many comforts. To the point I gladly pursue them rather than leaning on God. But death shows how temporal the temporary things are. I want to remove the world’s systems from my definition of ‘the good life’.
