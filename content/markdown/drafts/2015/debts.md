# Debts are not burdensome
I've taken on more debt again, nearly $100,000 with school loans, medical bills, and credit cards for living. I put it on a spreadsheet and see that I won't be done repaying for another 12 - 15 years if I go at the rate I'm going.
in the past this would create tremendous anxiety because it was in the opposite direction of where I wanted to be. That is, a man full of equity. But as I see this world not my kingdom, I've removed the definition that debt is a bad thing.
My God will supply all our needs and this is a factual promise
