# The stages of grief

The grieving process is commonly broken down in to five distinct stages. These five stages of grief are not experienced by everyone, nor are they always presented in the exact order as illustrated below, however these five stages of grief can help one identify what they are experiencing or have experienced and/or what others are experiencing.

## Denial

Denial describes an inability to believe something is true or a reality. This stage is commonly used as a way to cope with a loss by convincing oneself that nothing has actually happened or could happen.

## Anger

Anger is an emotion associated with feelings of resentment and hostility. This stage can be experienced by someone that chooses to focus on how they have been wronged, or done wrong, and these feelings are usually directed at oneself, others, or at a circumstance.

## Bargaining

Bargaining is the act of trying to negotiate your way out of the current situation. This bargaining can be internalized or can be done openly with others.

## Depression

Depression is when someone is in a state of great emotional dismay. One will often keep to oneself and will display much sadness. Depression is a state which, if prolonged, can be a serious mental health issue.

## Acceptance

Acceptance is the stage where one understands the reality of a situation and believes it to be true.

# Parental responsibility

The job of a parent is never done and is difficult to define, however, listed below are some of the most critical responsibilities of parents. During a marriage, some of these responsibilities may have lied more heavily with one parent or the other. For example, one parent may have been focused on the child's education while another may have prepared the meals. Especially in the case of dual households, these responsibilities must now be those of each parent. This can be a tremendous change in focus and can be a shock to both the parents and the children.

## Provide Basic Needs

## Create a Safe Environment

Creating a safe environment involves removing elements of a home which may be either emotionally or physically dangerous. It is easy to begin with those items that can be physically dangerous. Child proofing a home can be accomplished by moving breakable, toxic, sharp and other age-inappropriate items out of the reach of children. It is recommended that children also have their own space somewhere in the home where time can be spent alone. This becomes increasingly more important as the children become older.

## Provide Direction and Guidance

## Give Support and Motivation

## Discipline Bad Behaviors

## Encourage Education

## Spend Time

# What to bring to mediation

It will be important for the mediator to have as much information as possible so that the process runs smoothly. Below are some items one should bring to mediation so that important topics can be discussed and decisions made:

- Proof of Income and Potential Changes to Income

## Verbal abuse

Verbal abuse as it implies involves abuse delivered via spoken word and it is the most common form of abuse. Verbal abuse can be delivered through threats, general disrespect, cursing, etc. The purpose of the verbal abuse is to tear down one's self esteem, humiliate, manipulate, and isolate.

## Physical abuse

Physical abuse is when one party inflicts physical harm or causes another party to become intimidated through a physically violent act. Physical abuse is commonly understood to mean being struck or otherwise physically harmed by another, however this type of abuse **also includes acts involving physically harming or destroying other things of importance to a victim such as objects/possessions**, children, and pets. Signs of physical abuse include witnessing bruises, broken bones, and other obvious visible and common injuries.

Many acts of physical violence which fall into the definition of physical abuse are also criminal in nature and should be reported to the appropriate authorities. At the end of this section, a list of resources will be provided so that it is well understood how to report these issues once they are identified.

## Emotional abuse

Emotional abuse is also known as mental or psychological abuse. This type of abuse can be the hardest to identify however can have significant short and long-term effects on the victim. Emotional abuse may take many forms and can include humiliation, chronic embarrassment, statements of threat, isolation, or degradation. One of the main goals of the abuse is to suppress the victim's self-esteem so that they feel trapped and hopeless. It is common for attackers to recruit others to join in on the emotional abuse so that victims are abused by more than one person.

## Shared parental responsibility

One of the most important issues impacting divorcees with children is determining access to the children and primary residence. In the state of Florida, parents that divorce have what is called shared parental responsibility. This term and the related determination of primary residence may also be known as custody. Below is part of the related Florida statute:

"The court shall determine all matters relating to custody of each minor child of the parties in accordance with the best interests of the child and in accordance with the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act. It is the public policy of this state to assure that each minor child has frequent and continuing contact with both parents after the parents separate or the marriage of the parties is dissolved and to encourage parents to share the rights and responsibilities, and joys, of childrearing. After considering all relevant facts, the father of the child shall be given the same consideration as the mother in determining the primary residence of a child irrespective of the age or sex of the child."

"The court shall order that the parental responsibility for a minor child be shared by both parents unless the court finds that shared parental responsibility would be detrimental to the child...If the court determines that shared parental responsibility would be detrimental to the child, it may order sole parental responsibility and make such arrangements for visitation as will best protect the child or abused spouse from further harm. Whether or not there is a conviction of any offense of domestic violence or child abuse or the existence of an injunction for protection against domestic violence, the court shall consider evidence of domestic violence or child abuse as evidence of detriment to the child."

## Best interest of the child

A determination is made by the court as to what is in "the best interests of the child(ren)". The following factors are taken into consideration when an evaluation of the parent is being conducted:

- The parent who is more likely to allow the child frequent and continuing contact with the nonresidential parent.
- The love, affection, and other emotional ties existing between the parents and the child.
- The capacity and disposition of the parents to provide the child with food, clothing, medical care or other remedial care recognized and permitted under the laws of this state in lieu of medical care, and other material needs.
- The length of time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment and the desirability of maintaining continuity.
- The permanence, as a family unit, of the existing or proposed custodial home.
- The moral fitness of the parents.
- The mental and physical health of the parents.
- The home, school, and community record of the child.
- The reasonable preference of the child, if the court deems the child to be of sufficient intelligence, understanding, and experience to express a preference.
- The willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing parent-child relationship between the child and the other parent.
- Evidence that any party has knowingly provided false information to the court regarding a domestic violence proceeding.
- Evidence of domestic violence or child abuse
- Any other fact considered by the court to be relevant.

## Visitation

Visitation rights may be granted to the noncustodial or secondary residential parent. Visitation will be arranged with both parents. The custodial or primary residential parent may not refuse access to the child(ren) if the noncustodial parent does not pay child support or alimony payments. If visitation rights are not honored significant consequences can result which include court costs, attorney's fees, attending a parenting course (like this one), community service, financial obligations relating to travel of greater than 60 miles if convenient to noncustodial parent, and could also result in a change in custody or primary residence if in the best interest of the child(ren).

## Example of visitation schedule

For the purposes of this example, we will assume that the co-parents live in close proximity to one another and that the court has indicated that one parent is the primary residential parent (awarded custody) and the other parent is the secondary residential parent. This means that the children are the responsibility of the primary residential parent except during the awarded visitation times. A typical visitation schedule would allow the secondary residential parent to have visitation with the children every other weekend where the weekend begins on the Friday after school and ends when the children are dropped off at school the following Monday morning. The secondary residential parent would also typically be allowed visitation one weeknight per week which is also known as a dinner time visitation and sometimes becomes an overnight stay for convenience purposes if agreed to by the other co-parent.

## Build the shared calendar

Now that the calendaring system has been agreed upon, it's time to build the calendar. It is likely easiest to begin by entering exceptions where all other times would be realized as time with the primary residential parent. Using the example previously presented, parents can begin by entering in the visitation schedule on the calendar. It is recommended that the co-parents agree upon which night of the week (Monday through Thursday) should be the night designated as the designated dinner night for the secondary residential parent. Keeping this consistent will help to provide some stability for the children and will simplify planning for such events. Next, identify all holidays recognized by the family and designate which parent will have the children on each holiday with the understanding that the reverse will be true the following year. Now comes the time when the schedules of the children and parents are compared against the established calendar and additional events, vacations, and exceptions can be entered after agreement by the co-parents.
