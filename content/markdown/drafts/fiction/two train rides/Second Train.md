## Second Train
The other train is rugged, rusted, and you have to work. It's called the faith train. It has a sign that says "this train will take you to town." People read this sign but this ride doesn't look as fun and figure the Fun train is headed to town too.

the faith train doesn't have all the things the fun train has. The ride is slow, hard, and quiet. All the faith train has is a brochure that reminds them about the cliffs and the town.
