# management's core values

## Innovation / try new things

### “comes from the ground floor”

Those who make the widgets don’t just see it, they feel it. They feel what would make things faster, easier, simpler.

### “You guys are smarter than me”

Humility fosters innovation

### “Create the environment which allows to try new things”

Trying new things is an investment into people who will spend time failing

### “Needs some purpose, not core, needs to not be done before”

Confines foster creativity. [Skunk works]()

### “Tease out the innovation as a proposal”

Innovation starts with the cheapest thing possible. Permission in the form of a proposal.

### “Let you guys drive it”

Those who do are rewarded with opportunity to do more with what they start.
