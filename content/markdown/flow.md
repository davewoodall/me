# flow

I’m the kind of person who makes a list and then takes the time to sort it in what I deem most important. I want to start at the top. Which, is beginning my day with prayer and ideally time in Torah. I’m in no way implying a universal lifestyle. There are plenty of personalities that would rather die than make a list, let alone stick to one. 

What happens though is I get sucked into maybe the second or third highest priority and then end up getting focused on that. Take for example, this post. This post is no where near my top priority. Let alone even on my list. But, writing is. I enjoy writing and I have nothing but time to write. I’m torn because is the idea that I just have that done each day or in a particular.
