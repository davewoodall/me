# Issue 1

As a kid I used to collect comic books. I still have most of them. I remember walking into 7-11 on Edgewater Drive as a 7th grader and seeing Issue 2 of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I was so excited to have spotted a series so early! 

My friend Tim had Issue 1. Somehow I convinced him to trade me. Later he wanted it back but I refused. Up until this moment I thought we stopped being friends because of a girl but now I think about it - maybe he was too cool to tell me it was Donnie he was really in love with.

First issues have always been a big deal to me. They mean I  get to start the story from the beginning. That’s probably a common feeling many people have. Personally, I think it’s important because context is a defense mechanism. I’m scared of asking a dumb question about something “everyone knows”. Starting at the first issue means there is nothing else to know before this. My questions are justified because I know all there is to that point. (Maybe I’ll write about that later)

I’m now [5 months away from 40](). I have a lot of back issues. It’s the collector in me that wants to gather up all my old writings and line them up on my fancy new site and display the complete story. 

However, that is not a good idea because right now I’m not focused on the past. More so, I don’t even want to think about the past. I want to forget about the past. It’s hard to forget while editing old writings at the same time. 

The present is the most important time right now. Focusing on the tasks at hand; personally and professionally. Those are the topics I want to write about. So for those of you still reading, let’s call this Issue 1, Volume 2.
