# self-inflicted deadline

Thesis: A magazine is a self-inflicted deadline that helps me focus the things that are most important to me.

There are many ways to decide how to spend time.

I am a conflicted person when it comes to finishing things. I want to finish what I start but finishing is must harder than starting. Starting is easy, fun, and simple. It is the beginning of possibilities. Finishing, on the other hand is much more difficult. But just as important. Maybe even more so. 

Yesterday I started a project that I hope will help me finish better. It’s a way for me to set a schedule for 30 days then work toward it. I call it a magazine which means means;

- there is more than one issue
- The issues are scheduled
- The content is a collection
- You can find new and review old.
- has a theme

The format of a magazine feels perfect for me. It can help offset the bad and hone the good. I like the idea that at the outset of the next issue I get to pick a variety content to populate the magazine with topics that interest me. By setting those then I know what I need to focus on for the next 30 days. If I forget, just refer back to the _forthcoming_ issue. That’s the beauty - it’s a document I’m not only writing but it benefits me to read it too. Kind of like the way they say reviewing goals daily is an effective way to accomplish them.

I don’t have a problem so much with commitment but rather picking what I’m committing to. So, if I start with a self-inflicted deadline then that means whatever I am working on should. The kind that I want to keep. A deadline that implies that I need to finish what I start.
