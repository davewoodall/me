## Chapter 4

- 4
“Circumcise yourselves to YHVH And remove the foreskins of your heart, Men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, Or else My wrath will go forth like fire And burn with none to quench it, Because of the evil of your deeds.”

- 14
Wash your heart from evil, O Jerusalem, That you may be saved. How long will your wicked thoughts Lodge within you?

- 22
“For My people are foolish, They know Me not; They are stupid children And have no understanding. They are shrewd to do evil, But to do good they do not know.”

- 23
I looked on the earth, and behold, it was formless and void; And to the heavens, and they had no light.

- 24
I looked on the mountains, and behold, they were quaking, And all the hills moved to and fro.

- 25
I looked, and behold, there was no man, And all the birds of the heavens had fled.

- 26
I looked, and behold, the fruitful land was a wilderness, And all its cities were pulled down Before YHVH, before His fierce anger.

- 30
And you, O desolate one, what will you do? Although you dress in scarlet, Although you decorate yourself with ornaments of gold, Although you enlarge your eyes with paint, In vain you make yourself beautiful. Your lovers despise you; They seek your life.
