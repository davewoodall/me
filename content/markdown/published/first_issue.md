# Where to start...

I collected comic books as a kid. I remember as a 7th grader walking into 7-11 on Edgewater Drive and seeing Issue 2 of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I was so excited to have spotted a series so early!

My friend Tim had Issue 1. Somehow I convinced him to trade me. Later he wanted it back but I refused. (And you know... up until this moment I thought we stopped being friends because of a girl but now I think about it... maybe he was too cool to tell me it was Donnie he was really in love with.)

## I have issues

First issues have always been a big deal to me. They mean I get to start the story from the beginning. That’s probably a common feeling many people have. Personally, it’s important because I treat context as a defense tactic. I’m afraid of asking a question about something “everyone knows” and looking dumb. So, starting at issue 1 means there is nothing else to know before this moment. My forthcoming questions are justified because I know all there is up to that point. (Maybe I’ll write about that later

I am 5 months away from 40 which means I have a lot of back issues. It’s the collector in me that wants to gather up all my old writings and line them up on my fancy new site and display the complete story.

But I'm resisting that urge because it's difficult to think about the past. Right now, I want to forget the past. As you might imagine, it’s hard to forget the pastif I'm editing and consolidating old writings.

## Forward thinking

The present is the most important time right now. Focusing on the tasks at hand; personally and professionally. Those are the topics I want to write about. So for those of you still reading, let’s call this Issue 1, Volume 2.
