Erich, 

It was good meeting you and getting a chance to hear some of what you're going through. I'm really sorry. As you know, I'm going through something similar and found it encouraging to know I'm not the only one dealing with this. 

I made a playlist of some of my favorite Dave Grohl moments. The first one is the man crying clip, which is pretty funny. There's some foul language in these clips so try not to watch around your kids :-)
