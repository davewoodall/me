# cognitive dissonance 

About three months ago I was learning different ways people determine which day is the Sabbath. Some claim it’s the 7th day on the Gregorian calendar. Others claim it’s the 7th day after a New Moon which means the Sabbath is not strictly on Saturday. Both sides have compelling arguments. As an aspiring Torah observer, I was torn on which day to honor the Sabbath. 

Around that same time I came across the term Cognitive Dissonance. 

Definition;
> the state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes, especially as relating to behavioral decisions and attitude change.

Cognitive dissonance describes the land in between convictions and clarity. While the definition was clarifying of what I was experiencing, I found the realization to be troubling. I want to know what the truth is and it bothers me that I can have two seemingly right ideas at odds with one another.

I’ve had some time to accept that cognitive dissonance is a real thing. It is a requirement if I am to grow. It means that the ways I am changing are not simply within my own comfort zone.

P.S. - I’m memorizing Psalm 119

> Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the law of YHVH. Psalm 119:1
