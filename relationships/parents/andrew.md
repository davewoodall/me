While we were driving from Denver to Missoula, we stopped for the night in Sheridan, WY. We went to a brewery and a local named Drew and I struck up conversation. We had a lot in common. He mentioned his dad was a crackhead and he never saw him, maybe ever. Then he told me that he and his wife are getting a divorce and he moved up from Denver to be with his 9 month old first born, rather than Smoke weed in Colorado. Then he shared with me his earth crystal and a complementary stone that he has carried around for over 5 years or so. I explained that we're also similar in that I carry around a physical representation of my beliefs and had a free opportunity to explain what my tassels meant. "There are 5 knots which represent the 5 books of Moses."

I asked him if I could ask him a question. I explained that I think about death and have concluded there are at least 4 possibilities of what happens when we die. I've had the time to think through these four. I also attempted to find a fifth, which is why I was going to ask Drew.

"How many possible options are there for when we die?" He began with one of the four. This is when he pulled out his earth crystals. "These are my gods!" He exclaimed. It's entirely possible that his joy was from the spicy beer we were drinking.

He explained what I think is the most unlikely, yet viable option. That each person is in charge of their own eternity. (This is what Mormons believe. That we came from Kolab and will become gods of our own planet.)

He carried on for probably 5 minutes and I just listened and sipped my spicy beer. I don't remember what I asked him but I really wanted to know what he believed.

Andrew is 27 and he easily agreed on the 2nd option of what happens when we die. I call it the Crash Test Dummy option. We just end this whole thing by smashing into a concrete wall and cease.

As we were saying all that could be said about the CTDO Andrew began to bring the conversation back to Option 1. I politely interrupted him since I didn't finish my 4 options. I just held up four fingers and said. "Now we're about to start talking about Option One again. We're at a crossroads. I'd be happy to go back to talk Option 1, but I just wanted to point out that we haven't mentioned Options 3 or 4 yet."

At this point in the story, it was time for Nathan and I to call it a night since we were up early for the drive to Missoula. It also happened at the time when Drew got up to go to the bathroom.

I offered to give him my email during our conversation about being alienated fathers.

Who am I writing this letter to? I'm writing to Andrew. I'm also writing to my Parents since they want the play-by-play while I'm gone.

Why here? Because I'm not on social media any more and I don't have any stamps handy. Plus, This is what I do for a living - make web pages. So this is not a difficult exercise. Lastly, please don't tweet this. Let's keep this our secret letter. Feel free to share by word of mouth, but I'm not writing with honesty and transparency to be noticed, viral, famous, or known.

\_dw TODO - respond to Andrew
I love that question!
