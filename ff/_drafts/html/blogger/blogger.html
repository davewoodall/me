  Let's take a stroll down memory lane...

<span class="bg-1 text-1">
  2005 was the golden age of MySpace. MySpace let users write HTML to customize their profile. I thought MySpace users were teenagers learning HTML/CSS/JS in high school and applying their computer literacy to customize profiles. I thought that I missed the Internet bus. But as it turns out those <i>whizzkids</i> were just a fantasy of mine. MySpace wasn't full of coders and I didn't miss the bus afterall.

  Remember Blogger? It was my first blog circa 2002. It was the blog we used for my music club, <a href="http://afterburnersclub.blogspot.com/">Afterburners</a>). Back then I would go into the  <i>Customized html</i> section without realizing I was diving into an XML based template. No wonder I was lost! I recently started a new <a href="http://wwwoodall.blogspot.com">blogger</a>). (here's the <a href="https://wwwoodall.blogspot.com/2017/01/what-hell.html">backstory</a>)). What I didn't realize until tinkering around this go is that this new Blogger of mine is fast becoming the kind site experience I thought MySpace was 12 years ago. I have become one of the <i>whizzkids</i> and doing to my Blogger what I thought MySpace users where doing to their profiles.

  You might be asking yourself why I'm doing this. First off, it's a lot of fun doing something I envisioned <i>other people</i>  doing 12 years ago. I thought <i>everyone</i> saw it this way and maybe they did and I'm still catching up. But from the looks of things, people would rather write and publish with click a button. I like that my content is the combination of writing in IAWriter, coding HTML/CSS in Atom, and managing version control in GIT/github. I'm using all dimensions of my skills to post content. This is also leveling up my Chrome Dev tools skills. Additionally, hacking on a Blogger is a great way to practice Progressive Enhancement. By designing markup, styles, and animations around the content (As <a href="https://adaptivewebdesign.info/">Adaptive Web Design</a>) explains) I am learning that the web should be content driven design.
