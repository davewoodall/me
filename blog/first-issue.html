          <h1 class='h1'>Where to start...</h1>
          <p class='p'>I collected comic books as a kid. I remember as a 7th grader walking into 7-11 on Edgewater Drive and seeing Issue 2 of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I was so excited to have spotted a series so early!</p>

          <p class='p'>My friend Tim had Issue 1. Somehow I convinced him to trade me. Later he wanted it back but I refused. (And you know... up until this moment I thought we stopped being friends because of a girl but now I think about it... maybe he was too cool to tell me it was Donnie he was really in love with.)</p>

          <h2 class='h2'>I have issues</h2>

          <p class='p'>
            First issues are a big deal. It means starting the story from the beginning. Knowing that I'm starting at the beginning gives me a sense that I have complete context.
            I view context as a defense tactic. I’m afraid of asking questions “everyone knows” the answer to but me. Starting at the First Issue keeps me looking like a fool. I can tell when someone says something that is not true.
          </p>

          <p class='p'>
            I am <a href="https://wwwoodall.blogspot.com/2017/01/6-months-to-40.html" target="_blank">5 months away from 40</a> which means I have a lot of back issues. It’s the collector in me that wants to gather up all my old writings and line them up on my fancy new site and display the complete story.
          </p>

          <p class='p'>
            But I'm resisting that urge because it's difficult to think about the past. Right now, I want to forget the past. As you might imagine, it’s hard to forget the pastif I'm editing and consolidating old writings.
          </p>

          <h2 class='h2'>Forward thinking</h2>

          <p class='p'>The present is the most important time right now. Focusing on the tasks at hand; personally and professionally. Those are the topics I want to write about. So for those of you still reading, let’s call this Issue 1, Volume 2.</p>
