      that used to be difficult or time consuming becomes easy to accomplish.

        Consider how difficult it is for people in America who don't know English.
      </span>
       That is how I felt about the Internet before I learned to code. I knew how to consume the web, but trying to convey what I wanted to was impossible.
    </p>

    <p class='p'>
      I wanted to live there without being bound to a translator. I describe the web as a country called 'InternetLand'. In InternetLand, HTML is the new English and I sensed there was more opportunity in InternetLand than in America. So I sold my business and set sail for a new life as a developer. That makes my career path from graphic designer through entrepreneurship to programmer.
    </p>

    <p class='p'>
      Now that I know the languages means I can focus on the ideas. I am now able to be creative again. This ability to freely speak online without use of a social network is exteremly liberating. Every account I delete is an investment back into concentration which is a hot commodity these days.

        Which leads me here.
      </span>
      The more I code, the better I get. I've already started <a href="http://fakefarm.com">fake farm</a> as a way to practice. But that is a different neighborhood of coding. This freshly pressed magazine you're reading is another way for me to practice. This is frontend - html, css, javascript, plus content. I call it <a href="./2">4 dimensional blogging.</a>
