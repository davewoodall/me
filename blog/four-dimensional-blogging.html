  <h1>4D blogging</h1>
  <h2>Copy is just the beginning</h2>

  <p class='tldr'>TL;DR Four Dimensional blogging says  posts should be copy and code. Copy is just the beginning. The next step is to enhance your copy with custom code because that's what we We who love to code should add it to what We know code how to code and should use it creatively too.</p>
  <p>
  Many Web leaders will say content is king. Start with the content. Then, take that content and consider how to present it semantically in HTML. Only after the content is semantic should the developer consider enforcing the content's with CSS. JavaScript is considered an enhancement and should be used last.
  </p>

  <p>
  Most of the developers I know don't actively blog. They say it's because they don't know what to write. What they're referring to is the copy. They know how to write the remaining stuff.
  </p>

  <p>
  What if developers thought of blogging as a way to write all four dimensions (4D). Afterall, each of those four dimensions is a literacy in of itself. Why pretend they're not??
  </p>

  <p>
  Many developers who do blog say to 'write for yourself' because they say nobody is actually going to read it anyway. Well, take that to the extreme and write things that are invisible to the reader. Focus on writing the underlying code to support the content!
  </p>

  <p>
  This might sound like a lot of work. It's true that it's more work than writing a tweet and forgetting about it. 4D blogging means you are practicing all your writing in small segments and letting each piece support the previous.

    <h3>Rant because I can!</h3>

  <p>
  Progressive Enhancement says that your content does not need to look the same on every device, browser, or connection speed. Take that philosophy and put it to your blog posts. You don't need a perfect template. This is your blog, dammit! Your creative tools are text, code, and your imagination. Blog templates are for people who don't know how to do what you do. They are illiterate to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That is why platforms like Medium exist. For people who can't code. But you can code. And you should. You don't write the exact same lines of copy for each blog and you shouldn't write the exact same lines of code either. Blogging is a creative process and you shouldn't worry about effeciecy, templates, or anything else. This is your creative space. Let your mind wander into words to say, or funky animations. OR some weird transition you think would be cool to drive home an image. You get. it. Let each blog post you create be something new.

    <h3>Logistics</h3>
  <p>
    So, I've started doing this using <a href="http://wwwoodall.blogspot.com" target="_blank">blogger</a>. But their HTML and workflow is terrible. I tend to code in Atom then export etc. But that is painful. Then, I thought about Codepen. I just discovered that CodePen will export this content into a Gist. That's handy. As this post, which I'm currenly writing on CodePen is demonstrating (to myself). But Codepen is not really in blogform to be shareable with the world. (Maybe it is but - I mean moreso in the tranditional blog format.) For example, <a href="http://www.cash.me/$grandma" target="_blank">Grandma</a> would get lost here so I'd rather send her a traditional URL to a single page she can click around. That is's a great place to write drafts. My thought is I will export to gist then copy.
  </p>

    <p>But here's my other point. That rant above about logistics was just mental vomit. Where else am I going to type it than here and now. But that just exhasusted my writing muscles. I want to go back to coding. So, I just wrapped this whole thing in a '.draft' class and going to edit it with something cool. Why? Because this is my blog and I'm allowed to post rants and incomplete thoughts. feel free to vomit copy all over your blog and come back to edit it later. </p>
