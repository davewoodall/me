# Breadcrumbs

My path to Senior Software Developer has been as follows

- Didn’t have a career path provide
- Stumbled into entrepreneurship, of sorts
- Read INC, the entrepreneur’s magazine
- INC had a segment about project mgmt tools, and Basecamp was one of them.
- I fell in love with backpack and basecamp
- learn about rails
- rails teaches me about ruby
- learn about ruby
- start attempting to learn rails
- learn html/css as a break from ‘backend’ stuff
- learn basic rails
- discover rails devs need to know javascript
- focus on js
- along come SPA’s so i add angular
- back to CRUD, i focus on TDD
- TDD tells me the goal is OO
- OO tells me I learn OO by recognizing smells
- smells tell me there are techniques called refactorings
- refactoring drives me back to SOLID
- solid drives me to TDD
- TDD explains that it’s more than unit tests, we need E2E tests
- E2E tests are a bit far fetched because they are slow
- slow tests can be overcome if you detatch tests from Rails
- detaching from rails is because OO is about following principals that let you not need to know what the business is doing - we can focus on writing OO, as long as you have a strong Test suite to refactor toward OO. 
- By the way, did you realize all these OO concepts are really driving you to common conclusions? They’re call Design Patterns.
