# The Sabbath

_Keep the Sabbath day to santify it. Exodus 20:8_

## Why is the sabbath?

The sabbath has many reasons to be remembered. It is the seventh day after God created the heavens and the earth. By remembering the sabbath, you are reminded that evolution is wrong and so is the world which proposes such lies. Additionally, by resting, you also demonstrate that you trust God, not your labor, to meet your needs. Keeping the sabbath keeps you spiritually healthy.

## What is the sabbath?

Is it "a" day of rest or "the" day of rest. Are we allowed to pick which day the sabbath is? Or, is it assigned similarly as your birthday is assigned? Would it bother you if people celebrated your birthday near, but not on, the day you were born?

## When is the sabbath?

It is on the 7th day. But when is the 7th day? The Gregorian calendar is a static calendar. Meaning, it is not influenced by the movements of the sun or moon, which are for tracking days (among other things.);

> And God said, â€œLet there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years"
> - Genesis 1:14

Further, the 7th day (Saturday) is named after the god of Saturn, Saturn's day.  The Gregorian calendar is [7 days of pagan gods](https://www.crowl.org/Lawrence/time/days.html). How can we be sure a line up of pagan deities follows the sabbath?
