## Intro
Faithful in little is faithful in much. Can that also be described of wisdom? For example, how much of life can be learned from a banana. A banana goes through green, gold, and brown stages. What if that's a map of us?

## Green
When we are green, we are learning and trying to figure things out. At this stage we could say that we're not ready. In software, we use this terminology that a new person is 'green', or even 'super green'. It took me at least 4 years before I could feel I'm not green.

## gold
But soon, we mature and turn gold. This is the stage where we thrive. We are ready and excited to attack all sorts of dreams in our hearts. We are told that you can accomplish whatever you want. But thriving feels so good and natural. Our bodies, minds, and experiences are at their prime. Now is the time to strike. This gold stage of life can be long or short. People can also enter into it early or later in life.
Gold is not only a professional pursuit. There are many who seek golden value in the the christian circles by having the most to say, offer, and serve. The idea is that in the golden stage, you are in pursuit of the top. There is a ladder you see and are climbing to get as high as you can go.
It the posture of postivite thinking 'whatever the mind can concieve you can achieve' really what we learn from Christ? I'm beginning to see that as a form of white witch craft as we chant spells over ourselves in a quest to elevate our posture to a better place.

## Brown
But sooner or later, you will begin to see brown spots on your golden body. Indicators that your time in your prime is limited. This scares a lot of people. Some cover their brown spots with gold paint to maintain the outward perception that they are still thriving. For they have defined their identity with the things they can accomplish inside their gold stage of life. How can I continue to excel if my body loses it's ability to perform? But brown is an inevitable place you will enter. This is where you stop and see that your a falable, weak, and temporal being.


## conclusion
However, green, gold, and brown is not just a description of age or ability. See the big picture that none of these are permanent will detach you from all three. I am neither thriving forever, nor am I dying forever.
Entering brown will show you how fleeting the pursuits of gold are. They cannoot be attained and in fact will create significant pain if you rest your identity on who you are and what you do in your stage of glory.
Entering brown at 37 is different than entering it at 67. What I see is I am still alive and well but my interests ahve changed. I am doing all I can to remove the alure of the gold and be available for God.
The brown stage of life is Going through what I have with olivia has moved me out of the yellow and into the brown stage of life much sooner. I've entered into the brown stage in a unique way. Sooner than I expected but also in an unexected way. I actually accepted it in a way that made it something I wasn't resisting. I think that's what major events do. They have the ability to make all the unimportant things you thought were important loose their grip on your mind.
Entering brown at 37 means I still have a lot of life left. I am not weary or tired, but I've left and continuing to encourage the departure of building my own kingdom. It has also shown me that life is not about a stage nor accumulation nor accomplishment. Life is the process we are going through to be formed into the likeness of Christ in a variety of environments.
