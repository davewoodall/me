## chapter 12

- 1
Righteous are You, O YHVH, that I would plead my case with You; Indeed I would discuss matters of justice with You: Why has the way of the wicked prospered? Why are all those who deal in treachery at ease?

- 3
But You know me, O YHVH; You see me; And You examine my heart's attitude toward You. Drag them off like sheep for the slaughter And set them apart for a day of carnage!

- 6
"For even your brothers and the household of your father, Even they have dealt treacherously with you, Even they have cried aloud after you. Do not believe them, although they may say nice things to you."

- 7
"I have forsaken My house, I have abandoned My inheritance; I have given the beloved of My soul Into the hand of her enemies.

- 8
"My inheritance has become to Me Like a lion in the forest; She has roared against Me; Therefore I have come to hate her.

- 10
"Many shepherds have ruined My vineyard, They have trampled down My field; They have made My pleasant field A desolate wilderness.

- 13
"They have sown wheat and have reaped thorns, They have strained themselves to no profit. But be ashamed of your harvest Because of the fierce anger of YHVH."

- 15
And it will come about that after I have uprooted them, I will again have compassion on them; and I will bring them back, each one to his inheritance and each one to his land.
