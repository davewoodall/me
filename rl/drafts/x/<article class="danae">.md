      <h1>I'm going to start taking notes about my divorce process.</h1>
      <h2>Danae took my sons and does not obey the law. I am supposed to be included my sons health decisions. Yet, government's have proven that soda causes obesity. Even a soda tax on purchase. (Pepsi moves out of CITY). Yet, Danae allows Oscar (8) and Wells (6) to drink soda even against my will for their most crucial developmental stages of their lives. She has withheld them against my will for <a href="">4400</a> days.</h2>

## this is the kind of markdown to html converter we need. So I can turn this writing experience into well parsed, copy/paste semantic html (and inserts all the important aria, alt, meta tags).  _shit. i forgot my idea between this rant and why I came back with a newer idea!_

teach an html / css / bb / api / music course called 'afterburners'.

Do you think it would make any difference in things if we started sending our requests on your company letterhead? To know we mean business from here too. For example, I'm thinking about explaining how danae is trying to exploit me for money. I want the record to show that she's not compliant - so I want Al to submit a motion back — just like this finance one i got yesterday. Dad can testify how she said she wanted to communicate without attorneys and then send the 3 of us 2 documents this week. Dad will be a witness to all this at my trial date this Summer!

- intro proof / reasons 
- body motions 
- concl -use his letter head and in the exact same format as Al's.

- here's my example…

## email to danae
Regarding? Danae, I'm coming down there on Courage's one year anniversary death to tell part two of your Naples Daily News report. The news wants to hear from me and I'm going to explain it to you in public that I am not the problem and I want to be our two remaining sons primary custodian. your own attorney shows you make less than 30k, living in your parents house, while you are given free gifts, and seeking to attend college, and help pay down your forthcoming debts you will be responsible for after this divorce. As the record shows, I make over $100,000 working from a 6,000 square foot home on 2 acres.

## print out doc
- ballard logo
- looks like SECOND FINANCIAL discoloure looks like
- all the motions i'm going to put in naples daily news by filing them in public as motions through our attorneys or naples daily news



What about this idea… Rob Sending a legal letter to al requesting we submit some motions of our own. I will list them out in the same format as the Financial Affidavit doc about all the cray things. I want to hand the document to Danae on Sunday when we drop the boys off that if she doesn't reason with us then I will submit my 'motion requests' to the Naples Daily News on 4/10

Same PDF document 
- to al / motions (requested on Rob's letter head)
- to Danae / 'my side of the story'
