Danae,

I give you my word that I will not speak ill of you to our sons.

I've since realized that there are at least two reasons you do not want the boys to have any private time with me. You are afraid that I will tell them the truth about you and your family. Second, the abuses of your past have turned our sons into your idols and as such you cannot bare parting with them to the point of lies, theft, and deceit. You have chosen your way and abandoned the gospel.

But let me give you my word that when the day comes that I am with our boys, without your interference, I will not waste one precious moment speaking about you. The 17 years I spent in vain trying to help you heal and mature were enough. I have no interest in talking about you to anyone and that includes our sons. I would hope that my silence with my own family (while you poison the well of relationships) demonstrates that I am not a slanderer or kidnapper like you.

You can rest assured that your actions and words are no longer a concern of mine. My only interest is having a relationship with my sons and beginning to repair the damage that has occurred while you stepped out from under your God ordained authority.

Knowing you this sounds hateful but that is because it is my experience dealing with you. You can rest assured that once I reconnect with my captive sons, much of my anger will subside. But while you remain defiant and obstinate you will continue to hear this tone. I am a father who's sons were take against his will 456 days ago and even though I moved to Georgia to try to save our marriage - you have destroyed our home, finances, marriage, and family and yet you take no responsibility for any of it.

I give you my word that I will not speak of you at all to our sons.
