### Danae


Hey Dave, I'll respond to your email when I get home today. For now if you can tell me if you're planning on seeing the boys this week that would be helpful. I can plan accordingly and have them bring stuff to school with them etc.

as for today I'm assuming you are not coming to pick them up at the commons after school.

### Dave

Just let me know when I can take them to GA to spend time with the other family they haven't seen in over a year. Thanks.

### Danae

Yes, unfortunately this divorce process is taking a while.
Overnights will be worked out through court in time, but please let me know if I can have the boys call you or f/t. And what days would work for you to see the boys while you're here. I'm happy to look at our schedule.
Maybe the family can spend time with the boys in Florida until a final plan is settled on.

### Dave

That's unreasonable and you have no right to withhold them from me like this. Shame on you.

### Danae

I'm not withholding them dave I thought that was what the judge said.

### Dave

Nonsense. Read the standing order from July, 2016 that you are in violation of. And please stop blaming Olivia's death for our marriage problems. Come up with a better excuse.

### Danae

I will ask my attorney where I might be wrong here.

### Dave

I've heard that before and nothing has changed so I won't hold my breath. Please just let me know when I can begin to repair the damage done to our sons who are 13+ months without their father. If you were being reasonable it would start with their spring break since you enrolled them into school without me.

### Danae

I'm just stating that I'll see if all is correct with my attorney. I thought there was a no overnights from the last hearing.
Where did you want them to go to school?
Interesting that you would blame your 13 month absence on me.

### Dave

I'll faceTime with the boys once you agree to release them to me in GA for their Spring Break.

## Monday, March 20, 2017


### Dave

I assume you have seen the ruling by now. I'd like to start FaceTime tomorrow at 5:30 - 6:30, on time please.

### Danae

Haven't seen a ruling yet but I'm sure I will tmr. They can't start at that time tmr due to after school sports. I can set them up around 4:30.

## Tuesday, March 21, 2017


### Danae

I'll have the boys call you at 4:30. They'll be happy to talk to you.

### Dave

The court order says 5:30.

### Danae

If 5:30 is convenient for you we can do that but your time will probably be cut off 5 minutes at the end due to practice.

### Dave

I am entitled to private conversations with them so if I am FT with them in a public place then please provide them with headphones.

### Danae

Sure!

## Wednesday, March 22, 2017


### Danae

5:30 FaceTime tonight?

### Dave

yes

### Dave

please try to have the ipad charged before facetimes.

### Danae

The charger seemed to work great. Glad you guys could talk so long tonight.

### Dave

Sorry if I lack the confidence to assume consistency.

### Danae

That's okay. Thanks!

## Thursday, March 23, 2017


### Danae

I have a meeting today that will run until 5 so the boys will be with friends until I can swing up to their friends house to grab them. I can have them FaceTime you as soon as I'm with them. That will more than likely be sometime after 5:30. If you want to FaceTime the boys for an hour tmr they'll have to start their convo with you at 5 because at 6:05 they will be with friends.
Let me know if you'd rather FaceTime them tonight at bedtime or if you have a time that better suites you after 6.

### Danae

My friend said that she can set her phone up to FaceTime you at 5:30.
This is her number:
+1 (239) 293-2160
If you can FaceTime that number instead of my number the boys will be ready to talk at 5:30 tonight.
Tmr they will be ready at 5:30 (or 5:00 depending on your schedule) but just after 6 they'll have to go as they'll be doing their church thing.

### Dave

Please just follow the law and have them available at 5:30 for facetime, with a charged ipad and a good internet connection.
I don't need all the excess details or excuses.

### Danae

So tmr you don't want to ft at 5?

### Dave

i'm following the only thing that can be enforced. The court order. Says 5:30 FaceTime until August. Please go read it.

### Danae

It says 5:30 - 6:00. Would you like for me to cut it off at 6:00?

### Dave

and now we see your true colors.

### Danae

Dave! Haha oh my goodness.
Seriously though. I'll love to keep them talking as long as it works. Maybe you can do some homework with them that would be really helpful for them. And they like doing that kind of thing with you.

## Thursday, March 23, 2017


### Danae

Hey! Call that other number I gave you the boys are with her
I'm with my attorney right now.
Maybe just call instead of FaceTime that will def work

## Friday, March 24, 2017


### Danae

Can we do FaceTime tmr at 5 -5:45 since the boys need to be in their youth group at 6? No prob if you need to keep it from 5:30-6:00

### Danae

Let me know if you want to ft until we get to the church. They have headphones

## Saturday, March 25, 2017


### Danae

Would it be possible if they could please FaceTime at 5:00 or earlier, this evening they have youth group at 6:00 and we need to leave no later than 5:45. That would be helpful.

### Danae

Can we make a time to try to talk about the boys and see if we can possibly communicate without a court date?

### Danae

They're ready for ft and let me know if you and I can try to talk over the phone.
Hey I am going to go ahead and take the boys to church since we haven't heard from you, unless you are able to call. Let me know and I'll wait. The boys did try to call.

### Dave

You haven't responded to any of the previous times I've agreed to speak without court, what makes this time different that you won't run away again if I said "yes"?

### Danae

The time that you asked me about communicating concerning the boys was right after you sent a troublesome email. Not a good combination. I'd like to try to communicate for their sake and future with both of us.

### Dave

Prove it.

### Danae

Haha ow my geesh.
I can talk next week after work..

### Dave

ok here's a test. Tell me what was the worst thing about me and the worst thing about you.

### Danae

Dave! I can't help but smile but hold on...

### Danae

one of the things that has been on my mind a lot is how much effort goes in to working hard for money, just to pay bills...and then knowing this to the degree that I know this now, I imagine that not being on the same page with your spouse and for that spouse to not participate in meetings that could help greatly with the household and family would be deflating to say the least..
That's something I've thought on and have wanted to apologize for. I'm sorry.
Not because money is more important to me now but because I can see how providing for our family is a sacrifice of love and yet needs much planning.

## Sunday, March 26, 2017


### Dave

Have you seen the order permitting me to have the boys 4/8 and 4/9 for the full day, each day? Please confirm that you'll obey that.

I know it's a big deal for you to apologize but that one wasn't saying anything new. We were married for more than 15,000 hours and there are many things you are not owning up to. And since you have the upper hand with our sons, send me whatever 'out of court' proposal you have in mind and I will be happy to read it.

### Danae

Ya! They're excited. Brb

Are you going to be able to talk next week after work about the boys? That will help us know if we can try to communicate with each other outside of court.

### Dave

i want to begin communications with you in writing, not over the phone.

i know you can write so that shouldn't be a problem.

## Monday, March 27, 2017


### Danae

Do you want to talk to Oscar again?

## Tuesday, March 28, 2017


### Danae

The boys have football today at 6. If you want to start talking with them at 5 let me know and I'll set that up. Otherwise they can FaceTime at the regular time with headphones or over the phone while driving to football. Can I try to call you while they are playing football?

### Dave

5:30 please with headphones. I assume you got my latest email that I only want to communicate in writing while we are in these legal proceedings. It probably shouldn't be a surprise that I don't really have much trust in what is said that you cannot be held accountable for.

### Danae

Okay, sounds good.

### Danae

[football photo]

They're blurry.


## Tuesday, March 28, 2017


### Dave

Why are you sending this to me? Do you finally feel guilty for taking them from their father?
I doubt it.

## Wednesday, March 29, 2017


### Danae

Jessica
+1 (239) 293-2160

### Danae

Use Jessica's number to call or FaceTime. She has headphones ready. Thanks

### Dave

Should I expect something in writing this week or have you decided not to communicate?

### Danae

I'll put the things that I wanted to discuss with you over the phone in writing in the next few days.

### Dave

It's been 441 days since you left with our 3 sons. I hope you have something meaningful to share.

## Thursday, March 30, 2017


### Danae

Ugh. It's not connecting we are trying again


### Danae

I'm working on transportation right now. Would you be willing to meet half way in the month of May for both visitations? Pick up and drop off.

### Dave
If I can have them for the week, then yes.

it's about time you start letting me see my sons. i am no more dangerous than you are to them.

### Danae

Please clarify the days that you are referring to

### Dave

whatever days you are

### Danae

I'm talking about the days in the parenting plan for May

### Dave

me too

### Danae

Great!

### Dave

what?

Did you just agree to let them stay with me for a week at a time in GA, in May?

### Danae

These dates set forth in the parenting plan:
May 12th-14th and May 26th-29th

### Dave

read the whole thing. those are judge ordered if we cannot agree. Don't you realize that they want the adults to make decisions but hiding behind lawyers and judges is how you are making this go on longer than it ever should have.

i'm not going to meet you half way if you don't meet me half way on anything...


## Friday, March 31, 2017


### Danae

Hey we're here. Are you good to FaceTime or do you need to pick it up tmr?

Think about coming to wells's graduation in May.

## Saturday, April 1, 2017

### Danae

Hey. If you need to FaceTime later today or just tmr no prob. You're gonna be here in a few days. They'll be excited to be with you.

## Sunday, April 2, 2017

### Dave

FT in 4m...

### Danae

They're ready.
Wells made a massive fort in their room so it's looking cluttered in there.

## Tuesday, April 4, 2017

### Danae

Boys are good to go with ft. Thy have headphones because we have o grab a bite to eat before football.

### Dave

_[ Received 2 letters from Cary Cliff related to parenting plan ]_

Why are you talking through lawyers about finances while you ask me to communicate with you directly, then not even send me anything about money? I wasn't surprised by this one..

### Danae

I don't know what you received.

### Dave

ask your attorney then.

### Dave

You seem to me to be acting very wicked or very dumb. Please help me see otherwise.

## Wednesday, April 5, 2017

### Danae

Any chance you can FaceTime or just call the boys right now so that wells can talk to you because he's not feeling great and he's not going to awanas tonight which means he won't be with Oscar while you're face timing at 5:30. Oscar's heart is set on going to awanas. So they will be split at 5:30. It will be easy for me to have wells call you from moms phone if you like when you're done talking to Oscar.. Let me know.

### Dave

Are you going to answer any of my emails about "communication"?

### Dave

The amazing thing is you still think I'm the source of your problems.

### Danae

\*regarding

## Thursday, April 6, 2017


### Dave

Please tell the boys I'm missing FT today and will FT with them tomorrow.

### Danae

Okay! They are excited about sat and sun.

### Dave

And please try to start them listening to Proverbs every night. Not sure why it is so difficult to get them to learn the bible.

### Danae

Hahaha. It's not! They are learning the Bible every day. We do the proverbs guy a few times a week usually.
At bedtime

### Dave

why then everytime i ask them they say 'no' or 'i forget'?

the point is not to just check it off a list but for them to actually remember it

### Danae

As far as proverbs go they just listen at night. At bedtime I've been reading a chapter of psalms most nights and then some nights I put proverbs on. Would you rather I read a chapter of proverbs instead of psalms?

### Dave

this is the first i've heard of it.

### Danae

That's because you and I haven't talked about it.

### Dave

i'm not going to pretend that my desires will be honored. I'll just keep asking them about Proverbs and hopefully one day they'll demonstrate some forward progress. thanks.

also, i don't want them drinking soda during this formative stage of their physical development. I think you're aware those sugar drinks cause obesity. please consider their physical development before feeding them junk food.

### Danae

Totally. I don't like soda either. I'm sure you remember. But once in a while as a treat I let them get sprite.

What do you think if they get sprite a few times a year?

What are your thoughts on proverbs though? I'm just thinking I'll read and Oscar can help read when it's not Kate a chapter a night or on nights that they are t getting in late from sports etc. let me know if you're wanting something other than that.

### Dave

Okay. Check with your attorney and let me know what you decide.

### Danae

Can you let me know what you are referring to that I will be deciding about?

I called my attorney today. I haven't heard from him yet.

### Dave

Sure. Let's start at the top and most current, pressing issue. How are we going to communicate, outside of the courts, about when I can start being with my sons at least 50% of the time in Georgia? Oscar and Wells are just as much my sons as they are yours and I can't even begin to imagine what you would do if I withheld our sons from you for over 450 days, or if I justified doing so with lies and half-truths about you - the way you have done so about me. I want at least 50% custody of our sons. How do we communicate about that?

### Danae

Let me know if we can talk as parents without the aggression and blind accusations.

### Dave

I'm still waiting for your plan since you have the upper hand. Or, are you looking for me to beg some more like I did on my hands and knees before you left last time?

What does it take for you to let our sons have their father? Remember, We only started drinking because you wouldn't address you sexual abuse with Gary or the Zenz.

not bc Olivia died as your tactic says before the judge.

If I was so dangerous why didn't you bring that up in mediation with Hayes Wicker. (It's because it wasn't true then or now. ) just tell me what you want, please.

I want my sons to have a father and I want to be with my sons - you are in between us because you are not getting your way. So, please tell me, what do you want?

### Danae

Oh my goodness dave.

You told me that you weren't going to quit the heavy drinking and pot smoking...

It was not a good environment at all for our family including you. I said we are going so that you can stop the smoking and drinking and let's do counseling and I said I'm not leaving and that I wanted to get back as soon as possible.

Even Gary asked me to come consider leaving and I wasn't leaving for good it was so that I could get out of your hair and give you space to stop the heavy drinking etc.. I wanted to come back as soon as possible with all my heart. You told me not to plan on us seeing you until a certain date and then you pushed it back. You didn't want us to come back yet remember? I'm not afraid to address anything sad from my childhood. I've had lots of counseling and as of right before we came to Florida my counselor said I was a strong woman and that I healed with grace and strength....

I have no problem addressing my childhood with anyone as I would think you would remember I talked openly with Gary and the Zenz about my past and my life.

Andrea binder was my counselor before I left Colorado and Gary was our marriage counselor. I shared with them both openly and honestly. I received good feedback and even positive encouragement and affirmation that I was not living in a dark cloud as it seems you are saying. Although I'm not saying I didn't have plenty to grow from and work on as a human being and wife. I wanted us to continue counseling and address all that you had in your heart about me. And for me to address what I wanted to grow towards you with and what was in my heart about you.

### Dave

Unfortunately, you should have spoken with me about it instead of all those other people. Andrea never heard my side and you threatened to leave me in front of Gary so - all that is pretty consistent with you defending your way or the highway.

### Danae

I wish it was "safe" for me to share my heart on here and say that I wish we could reach each other for the boys sake. I wish I could feel "safe" to be vulnerable and humble in response to your text. I don't like the idea of having to watch everything I say for it to not be used against me. It's all been really hard and I continue to love and pray for you.

### Dave

Just tell me what I need to do to see my sons.
correction - _Be_ with our sons without you telling me how it's going to be. They don't need another mother. They need their father.
You may think of yourself as the head queen but you have forgotten there is a king and he is the one who judges.

I am pretty sure you don't like the tone of these texts. They probably sound mean. But the problem is you don't listen regardless of what I say.
If I speak to softly, I'm heartless.
If I speak to calmly, I'm a robot.
If I speak to strongly, I'm a bulldozer.
If I tell you the truth, I'm a lawyer.

I can't win the tone game because it is your way of maintaining your perception of innocence. The only way I could get to you was to pay you off and judging by what I received from Cary - you're still at it.

### Danae

I definitely do not think I'm a queen hahaha.I wonder if you think all your dark perceptions of me are completely correct without any misunderstanding or misdirection or influence from the enemy.

### Dave

There is no excuse for withholding my sons from me for 449 days. You need to look in the mirror and realize how much your sexual abuse has warped your view of maturity. Look at your family - you are just like them.

Let me remind you (again) that you cheated on me our first year of marriage and committed credit card fraud. You were a child then and I had to be your dad. We talked to Denise back then in CA and I said "I don't want to be her dad". Fast forward to our 10 year anniversay when I said "15,000 hours things have to change" I was your effing dad for 10 years and I was sick of it. BUT I waited until after Courage to bring it back up with Gary - 3 more years of being your dad. Now you blame all this stuff on me because I began to call you out on your shit.


### Danae

I did take a credit card out in your name when we were first married at 24 years old and that was really immature and hard on you and I'll apologize again. I'm sorry. You took a credit card out in my name as well. I'm 2015 and 2016.
I did cheat on you before we were married and after apologizing for two years over and over again you said you didn't want me to apologize anymore and that you were done with that and over it. The Lord gave me that really neat dream in Nashville remember? His message to me was to stop rolling in my miserable agony over my sin and how much I hurt you and to accept His forgiveness and yours and to move on. I didn't apologize again after that so that we could move on and live, until you brought it up again while I was in Florida in 2016. I'm sorry. How can I apologize where you'll forgive me? It's a horrible heart wrenching betrayal and I'm sorry for it. You're right I was immature and I learned a very hard lesson and I needed to grow up. You were a forgiving husband at that time I thought but maybe you were harboring bitterness and hatred all this time? I don't know. If you remember a
conversation we had while I was here in Florida around February of 2016 I said I will say sorry a million times. I don't need your forgiveness anymore but I think you need your forgiveness.

## Friday, April 7, 2017

### Dave

I know You said "I'm sorry" but sadly you never changed from living as selfishly as you did back then - which is why it is still relevant.

Just like you were only leaving for "3 weeks". Nothing you say is true. You just said (and say) what you think people want to hear. I know firsthand and can honestly say you are not a trustworthy person. For 12+ years you played me by telling me what I wanted to hear but did your way when I wasn't around.

For 450 days now you have punished me, Oscar and Wells in order to get your way.

Plus, You seem to have forgotten I asked your permission to open a card in your name. You didn't do that to me.. you just did it in secret like you have done our entire marriage.

Plus you seem to have forgotten how many years I endured all your depression and lack of cleaning, cooking, or helping in any significant way as a supporting wife is supposed to when you refer to yourself as "a homemaker". But its what you learned from your damaged mom, so I get it.

The point is you have destroyed our relationship with your lies, deceit, and demanding of your way. It is selfish and the same childish behavior like when you cheated on me.

Please Prove me wrong. Think about our sons instead of yourself. They need me as much as they do you. You have left me for the last time and so we are not going to be together anymore.

Since you won't share with me any kind of written plan, I'll go ahead and share mine...

I want at least 50% custody in Georgia and I want you to stop making me jump through all these ridiculous hoops to be with my sons before the divorce is finalized. Oscar and Wells deserve me 50% of the time and the law says so too.

Once you stop holding them hostage then you and I can figure out how to be cordial again. But while you act the same way you did when you cheated on me then it will be impossible to trust you.

I will be in the driveway at 9am tomorrow and will handle feeding them breakfast.

When you don't try to gain understanding or ask questions (⬆️you taught me that) Your sad, dark, untrue perspective clouds your judgment and you're then lead by your emotions and lies instead of God and truth.
I'm here when you're ready to have a conversation to gain understanding in order to do what's best for our boys. When you spew your accusations you're not accomplishing anything except looking foolish. 
I want to genuinely apologize for any ways that I offended you and I can go there when you can receive it. You don't seem to be in a place to hear apologies or receive perspective, truth, even wisdom, outside of your own dark, comfy hatred. 
You're missing it Dave. 
I know you're not going to hear me on this but I wish You would Ask the Lord to help you forgive, even see truth in this whole matter outside of just what you think. 
I shared this verse below just as a thought. I'm not trying to condemn with it just thinking it's a good word for us. 

The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are clear, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness! Matthew 6:22-23 

Boys are excited about their day with you and maybe Golli and Pops are with you. and that will be a sweet time. 
Oscar has a birthday picture for pops that he drew. 
dave woodall
Okay, then.. please please please teach me how to have a conversation with you that includes you showing some semblance of humility and cooperation. I'm done letting you control me.
dave woodall
If I "forgave" you as you claim, then would you let me have shared time with our sons in GA without all this legal battle? Or what about me having them as primary custody and you go to college and counseling for a few years and try to get yourself self-sufficient. I would help you become independent and I would love to raise our sons. You could accomplish some of the things you have said you need to do now that you're a Floridian.

Are you doing breakfast with the boys again?
+13039568748
The boys were not interested in eating breakfast this morning. And I assumed you were going to breakfast anyway. 
Monday, April 10, 2017 4:34 PM
+13039568748
Wondering if you want to talk to the boys right now instead of at 5:30 they can talk to you at 5:30 but they're going to be at the beach and we're gonna meet people there. I have headphones but I just thought maybe you would rather talk to them right now then talk to them at that time. Or if you want to talk to them tonight when we get home
dave woodall
The Judge's order says 5:30. Please honor the law and stop preventing me from talking to my sons. I have a right to facetime with them everyday from 5:30 to 6. 
I'm willing to have a phone call with you next week if that's the only way you are able to communicate. do you still want to have a phone call (like you said you wanted to last week)?
+13039568748
Dave you talked to them at 5:30 today. You got off with them. I did NOT prevent them. 
I would really like to try to do a phone call. 
dave woodall
Oscar got off the phone because you double booked him to hang out with you at the beach. How is that not prevention?
And I didn't get to talk to Wells either.
Open Hangout
