# Intro

Growing Object Oriented Software Guided by Tests is the overlap of two subjects. First, it assumes an awareness of OO. Second, it touts the other discipline of testing, or TDD. Although the book has ‘oo’ in the title, this is really a book about testing.

I was recommended this book by Sandi Metz during MetzFest. Sandi says Testing is the _Back against your wall_ when it comes to refactoring toward OO. As such, testing is not an option but a requirement for OO.
