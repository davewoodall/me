## Relational
- work
Iâ€™m an absent father. But that is not by choice. It is a long story that one day I will get to tell to my sons. I love them and want to teach the to be godly men. That is the only thing in this life that keeps me going. I want to figure out the ways I can do this.

- start
I want to start creating deliverables that they can read, watch, listen to now. Be it books, youtube, or other. I want them to see that though we are apart, I have not forgotten about them.
