1 I will bless the Lord at all times;
his praise shall continually be in my mouth.

2 My soul makes its boast in the Lord;
let the humble hear and be glad.

3 Oh, magnify the Lord with me,
and let us exalt his name together!

4 I sought the Lord, and he answered me
and delivered me from all my fears.

Psalm 34: 1 - 4
