[Note]
   The world tells you to follow a passion something that you love to do
   and think about they don’t even care what you do you could be in a
   painting or butterflies or building robots or computers or science so
   you can do whatever you want to be into as long as you’re passionate
   and into it. so what I’ve decided is that the Bible is worth studying
   knowing at minimum because it’s a fascinating book both history and
   prophecy so I’m not worried that I’ve wasted my life but studying the
   Bible. it is in the Bible that I have change my views about God and
   myself and mankind that is not a bad thing and it is worth thinking
   about regardless of what you’re passionate about then what’s more
   important is that super natural war we fight makes me question whether
   he studying the Bible is worthwhile this is not even. factoring in the
   point that the Bible is a supernatural book discussing eternity.

   my point is I don’t even find other subjects of the world or more
   interesting let alone crucial to knowing if eternity is at stake

[Note]
   there comes a point in life when you begin to realize you’re just
   going with the flow and you decide to stop going with the flow. for me
   that day is when I realized that I want to follow the whole Bible
   which includes the Torah
