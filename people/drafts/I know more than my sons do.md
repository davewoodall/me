# I know more than my sons do
I am coming to the point where I have a reason to share my thoughts. My two sons who are three decades behind me. No matter how little I know, they know even less. I want to help them at least get _here_. That’s not only a desire but it’s also a Command.

> You shall love YHVH your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates. **Deuteronomy 6:5-9**

My preference would be to teach them day by day and in the quietness of my own home. But for a variety of reasons, that option is not currently afforded to me. As such, I need to write out the things I want to say to them. What they do with my teachings is between them and YHVH.
