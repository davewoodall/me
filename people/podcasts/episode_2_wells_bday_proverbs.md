Okay back to business -

Wells, now that you are 7 I want you to start paying attention to becoming a Godly man.

I'm not the only father that wants his sons to become godly men.

Did you know that proverbs is a book written by a father to teach his sons how to become godly men? It's like a instruction manual for your life.

We used to study proverbs together before bed. you memorized the first 28 verses. I know you didn't really understand what they meant but now that you are 7, i hope we can start talking about what those verses mean.

I'm going to read the first chapter to you so you have it. I want you to listen to the proverbs and think about them even while we're apart.

The first chapter has 3 parts.

the first part is the introduction - telling you who wrote the proverbs, what proverbs are for, and what you become by obeying these words

the second part tells you about fools. if a fool invites you to be with them do not join in. because they end up stealing and killing one another.

the third part says talks about wisdom is all around you but you have to look and listen for it. And that all people start without wisdom but we need to start looking for it like treasure. those who find wisdom find peace and safety. But if you ignore wisdom for too long, you will get into trouble.

So, here goes - I'm going to read Proverbsr  chapter 1 and want you to think about the words that I'm reading to you and come up with some questions to ask me later.

1 The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:

2 for gaining wisdom and instruction;
    for understanding words of insight;
3 for receiving instruction in prudent behavior,
    doing what is right and just and fair;
4 for giving prudence to those who are simple,[a]
    knowledge and discretion to the young—
5 let the wise listen and add to their learning,
    and let the discerning get guidance—
6 for understanding proverbs and parables,
    the sayings and riddles of the wise.[b]
7 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,
    but fools[c] despise wisdom and instruction.

Prologue: Exhortations to Embrace Wisdom

Warning Against the Invitation of Sinful Men
8 Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction
    and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.
9 They are a garland to grace your head
    and a chain to adorn your neck.

10 My son, if sinful men entice you,
    do not give in to them.
11 If they say, “Come along with us;
    let’s lie in wait for innocent blood,
    let’s ambush some harmless soul;
12 let’s swallow them alive, like the grave,
    and whole, like those who go down to the pit;
13 we will get all sorts of valuable things
    and fill our houses with plunder;
14 cast lots with us;
    we will all share the loot”—
15 my son, do not go along with them,
    do not set foot on their paths;
16 for their feet rush into evil,
    they are swift to shed blood.
17 How useless to spread a net
    where every bird can see it!
18 These men lie in wait for their own blood;
    they ambush only themselves!
19 Such are the paths of all who go after ill-gotten gain;
    it takes away the life of those who get it.

Wisdom’s Rebuke

20 Out in the open wisdom calls aloud,
    she raises her voice in the public square;
21 on top of the wall[d] she cries out,
    at the city gate she makes her speech:
22 “How long will you who are simple love your simple ways?
    How long will mockers delight in mockery
    and fools hate knowledge?
23 Repent at my rebuke!
    Then I will pour out my thoughts to you,
    I will make known to you my teachings.
24 But since you refuse to listen when I call
    and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand,
25 since you disregard all my advice
    and do not accept my rebuke,
26 I in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you;
    I will mock when calamity overtakes you—
27 when calamity overtakes you like a storm,
    when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind,
    when distress and trouble overwhelm you.
28 “Then they will call to me but I will not answer;
    they will look for me but will not find me,
29 since they hated knowledge
    and did not choose to fear the Lord.
30 Since they would not accept my advice
    and spurned my rebuke,
31 they will eat the fruit of their ways
    and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.
32 For the waywardness of the simple will kill them,
    and the complacency of fools will destroy them;
33 but whoever listens to me will live in safety
    and be at ease, without fear of harm.”
