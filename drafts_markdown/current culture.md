# Corporate Culture

Every corporate culture is different. Looking back on my time at living social, it had less meetings (at least at my level) but seemed to have lots of collaboration.

Lately I've been wondering what would be my most desireable culture. How will I find it if I don't define it? Before I can define it, I think I just want to identify aspects that are part of all healthy corporate cultures;

## communication
## structure
## collaboration
## contribution
## values
## formality
## warts
## customers

## structure
2 week sprints
standup daily
mr review daily
bug scrub twice a week
backlog grooming twice a week
retros every two weeks
demo every two weeks
