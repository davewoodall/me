# Aspiring Workflow

Uncle bob gave a talk about architecture that helped me begin to see where Rails ends and the business begins. As such, I want to try to follow his suggestions and create a t-shirt quoter. Here is the workflow I am going to attempt to follow;

1. Usecase
2. Gem
3. TDD
4. Plug into Rails
5. Create a Wrapper
6. Use the wrapper in rails
