# grown up topics

Topics of adults are more complex than those of Children. The same goes with the way to interpret the bible. If life is fun, care-free, and foolish then the words of the bible seem to be a real downer. 

But now I have experienced the loss of many things and people. I have questions about what _all this_ is really about. I am ready to listen to the sobering words of the bible.

Those words are not user-friendly. The words of the bible are deep, mysterious, uncomfortable, and hold the reader to a level of attention and accountability. 

I think the bible is one of those world views that is not the easiest offered. As such, there is an adjustment between what we experience and what the word says about ourselves, mankind, God, and our destiny. The bible is a humbling book. There are a lot of raw, real stories that make people uncomfortable. At first pass, they also seem completely barbaric and obsolete. However, upon further investigation the words are to be held in maturity.

The bible seems to be a book that has content for all ages and spiritual maturities. It has parables, wisdom, poems, stories, laws, loves, hope, graces, and justice.
