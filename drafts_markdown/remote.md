# remote slack
A slack channel for remote engineers of mid-sized companies.
4 purposes;
- help grow your skills
- maintain your remote network because the best jobs come from those who you can trust
- develop friendships in a private and safe place
- size matters. too small and it's too unstable. Too big and it has too much control. Looking for companies with the sweet spot.


- keep the momentum of remote life going _and_ thriving
- learning
- knowing that what we as engineers face is different than the company
- the best engineers to talk with are those who i work with regularly.
- phishme doesn't own us so i think we should have the ability to talk privately remotely since we can't all go out and grab a beer to speak freely.


would a private place for engineers to speak freely be valuable? 
if so, how should we do it?
- grow skills
- network professionally
- bond as friends
- safe
