# the bubble
I had no plans to attend college. But during the Summer I had graduated highschool I received a mass mailer from Libery University. It had offered $16,000 off college. "A college sending me something? This is odd." So I approached my parents who were shocked I would consider a christian college. Truth be told, Had that been a culinary school, I would have been making eggs benedict for 4 years. In the following month I had applied, been accepted, and had 3 weeks to prepare for going to college.

My experience was a 4 year Summer Camp. Tucked in the Blue Ridge mountains, there was always something to do there. I met my wife and other really incredible people.

I felt dirty from my high school decisions so I was excited to be surrounded by some rules and direction. I welcomed following those things. It was something I don't feel I had before so It was a nice change.

I had to wear a tie to class everyday. On top of that, church was just short of a forced event. Since I wore a tie to class, the last thing I wanted to do was dress up for sunday's. That oppression was the ingredients to start a t-shirt company called 'church clothes'. I did it as a creative outlet. Around campus I developed a reputation for making t-shirts so a few bands approached me about making shirts for them. I thought it a fun idea.

Looking back on that time, I think of starting a t-shirt company, organizing food eating contests, being a camp counselor, taking a year off to live in Utah, helping manage a skate team, taking a cross-country road trip, back packing eurpose and having fun.

I spent two Summers working construction and I hated it. The job started so early I would look out the window hoping the darkness was due to rain clouds to prevent me from having to go. Feels like there should have been a converstaion during those accumulated 2 summers of hated work that my dad would have inquired about his son and asked what he would want to do for a vocation.

I ended up taking a year off college. The first part was to spend 6 months in Utah. During that summer I worked landscaping. One day I was changing a blade on a mower and the wrench slipped. I got 13 stitched but also nearly could have lost my thumb.  Again, I came to the realization that I didn't want to do landscaping for my life - so I went back to school with a new resolve to get good grades and learn something while there.

I never really had any direct conversation that my life and times at college should be preparing me for something. That I should be there to earn some skills or think about my future. I was immersed in a bubble and did whatever I wanted.

The word 'career' was mysterious and uncertain for me. As I see it now, it makes a lot of sense why children follow in their father's trade. He is supposed to model something that they get good enough to make an income doing. I didn't have that. I had the opposite. I remember a few distinct times when my father would volunteer. "Son, my father didn't instruct me in my career and I don't know how to instruct you in yours." The amount of disappointment, uncertainty, and concern that produced made me scramble.

The simple basics of understanding how one's wired, then exploring hobbies to foster that feels like a simple activity that my father should have done in a direct opposition to the hurts his father gave him by not doing the same. I seem to only have that perspective after raising my two young boys. I don't see how my relationship with my father would excuse my behavior with my sons.

When I start going back to my childhood to think about my own memories and relationship with my parents when I was a child, that is the first thing that comes up. “Your father and Grampa were always fighting”

That answer was sufficient for a while.

I don’t know what they were doing but it wasn’t raising me. My sister had once said it that they were ‘for us, they just weren’t with us.’

Throughout the time, I began to gravitate to the description of 'entrepreneur'.

The first Summer after I graduated liberty I went to Flordia to be a camp director for a small summer camp. It was affilicatd with the skate team I helepd managed. It turned out to be such a confusing time that as soon as it was done, I regrouped in Lynchburg.
