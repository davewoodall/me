# no man's land

I had a picture of life with Danae and providing nice things and doing so from a title that garnered respect and admiration for me. That, I had arrived and you can follow my lead.

I had taken the GMAT 3 times. I had written 20 essays with hours of revisions and 4am mornings to do so. I had sought to juggle this.  I applied to all four schools the third round. This is not ideal but for time and such I couldn't make the 2nd round cut. It was about 2 weeks before I received a response. It was from Wharton and they said no. Then, I receive my letter from harvard and they said no. Stanford. No. Kellogg - Waitlisted. Phew, I dodged that bullet. I guess it looks like I'm going to Kellogg.

Over the next few months I decided to reapply to Harvard and Kellogg. I figured that Harvard turned me down because I was in the third round. And that kellogg I was 'in' because I was waitlisted. By this time, I was already finished with Ouray and was working full tiem with AMB3R.

December, 2011 I receive letters from Harvard No, but also Kellogg had said no again. I was so convinced that I was going to be accepted to grad school that I had already helped find my replacement at my day job. I had set a date and was moving forward.

Okay. Let's just freeze everything and just stabalize and figure out what's going on. All of the sudden AMB3R got more valuable in my eyes. It was all I had left.

Nearly that same week the landlord called us to let us know they had sold the house and we had about a month to be out. Okay.

The day I received the letter from Kellogg, I was to have lunch with a guy who was offering to help new coders learn to code. I had been dabbling around and needed some guidance so I reached out to him. I was in shell shock and told him how I just heard the news. He was working at livingSocial at the time and told me about a  coding internship at LivingSocial, called Hungry Academy.

I applied and while we were waiting, we just started packing the house. we didn't know where we were packing to. During that week, LivingSocial emailed me that they wanted me to fly out to interview. We didn't have time and didn't want to get a new apartment if they were goign to hire me. So, we decided to put our stuff in storage for 2 weeks while we wait if we're going to move to DC, or stick around in Denver.

I also hadn't given up on the idea of attending Kellogg's part time MBA program. Maybe I would opt for that.

We moved out of our apartment, and were staying in a La Qunita in Denver while I flew to DC to be interviewed. I flew back and we stayed at some friends house for a few more days waiting to hear back on the news.

We didn't have any news and all our stuff was in storage. So we decided to just start driving East. We did not know where we were driving. We wondered if it would be Chicago, or DC. We drove until we reached topeka kansas when we had the idea to call my parents and ask if we could stay with them until we heard back. Of course they said we could. So, we charted course for Georgia. En route, the car engine blew up and we had to stay in a road side motel for 3 days but that's beside the point.

What we thought would be a two week word turned into 8 months of homelessness.

That homeless was trying to answer the same question 'what am I supposed to do?'. I had conceeded that an MBA program was my way of redoing and reconnecting but if I couldn't have that, then how am I supposed to get on the right track.

I heard back from Hungry Academy and they said no. I applied to a consulting job that i was told i would be 'perfect for' in Atlata. Their clients were in apparel. OH that's me for sure! I did not make it to the second interview.

There was a new code school in Chicago called 'starter leauge' that I applied to. I was accepted it was a 3 month program. Danae agreed and she went and lived with her parents for 3 months with the boys while i went to chicago.

I left starter league without any job prospects. Jeremy and I had begun to have a falling out. I wanted to either buy or sell AMB3R from him. I told him that in March but it wasn't until July of that Year we closed. I practially gave him the company. I was clueless on where to go. So, we went to Michigan and spent the summer at the lake house.
