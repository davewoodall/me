# The appraisal
My wife and I were renting our house. At the end the lease, the landlord told us he was going to raise the rent by $250. This was during 2005 when the market was exploding. We rationalized that it would be cheaper to buy a home than to pay the extra rent.

I've been getting into Prophecy latetly. Some of the first comments I hear are asking if it changes my views of salvation. To which I reply 'no'. It is my view that what they are ultimately asking is - is this a serve topic or one I have the option to ignore?
It is interesting to note how many beleivers are willing to add on duty, but then are selective to which duties they add. As if it is a balancing act between the two.
