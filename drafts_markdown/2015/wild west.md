We were in Colorado for two months before I got a call from a long-time friend in the t-shirt business. I was now a contractor for my day job. Jeremy wanted to start a business. At that point I was convinced I was getting out of the t-shirt industry. I had already spent nearly 15 years in and around t-shirts and concluded it was not the way I was going to make money. I was in Denver to go to grad school and become a real estate developer.

After a few discussions I changed my mind and decided that we could try to make it a go but we needed to hit $500k in sales or we should shut down. I was tired of 'playing business'. That was 6 months before grad school started so I had time to devote to working on the company.

While in school, I had mentioned to a professor that I owned my own company. He connected me to another apparel company who needed an art director. THey had bought ouray out of bankruptcy and were rebuilding it. My only condition was that I would still be allowed to run AMB3R on the side. I joined them and took the following semester off grad school to focus on my day job and side business. I also told them that I am pursuing Harvard and will leave _when_ i get accepted. My big thinking was probably due to how much hot air was in my head.

For nearly 3 years, my schedule was working a 40 hour day job as art diretor. Attending night classes two nights a week. spending another 10 - 15 hours a week on amb3r. Studying for the GMAT, and working on essays for Harvard, Stanford, Wharton, and Kellogg.

The routine was preparing us for our future and providing some income to pay down credit card debt from the previous season.

In 2010 Danae's brother Jake was shot and killed. This set us into another tail spin. I pressed on thinking that was the right thing to do.
