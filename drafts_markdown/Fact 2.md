Fact 2: The things we learn as children are oversimplified. 
Partially because grown ups either don’t know how to say things to us as children or because they simply don’t want to share the story. Others, is as children we have difficulty processing complexity so we tune it out. As such, our views of life can be stunted if we don’t go back and learn the truth in all it’s unsimplified aspects.
