This book is a book of beginnings. Of the universe, of the world, of man, and of you.

Will you be a person who chooses to recognize that no matter which world view you accept (biblical, atheistic, lawless) we all must submit to the fact that no man has all the answers. I do not have all the answers. I can freely admit that. We could probably also agree that the person who claims to have all the answers is either God, arrogant, oblivious, or crazy.

What Genesis begins is what we will do when we donâ€™t know. Will we default to what man says, what we feel, or what we believe as best we understand that it all ends with God. Another way to ask it, who has final say when you confronted with your own ignorance?

Genesis is for people who choose to live a life in search of God. It is the way we can rest when we do not know what is truth.
