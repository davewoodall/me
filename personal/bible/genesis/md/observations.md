- Israel splits his family into 2 camps. (ch. 32) Significant of the splitting of two kingdoms?

- Isaac did not go down to Egypt during his famine, unlike Abraham and Jacob who do.

- Abraham and Isaac tell the authorities their wives are their sisters. (Deuteronomy says no man is to lay with his sister)

- Ham sees his father’s nakedness. That term is used in Deuteronomy (twice) to speak agains sleeping with your mother. Is that what happened?

- Spirit over surface of waters (2:2). Ark over the surface of waters (5:24)

- Jacob buries Debroah, his mother’s servant

- Jacob to Rachael - Am I in the place of God to close your womb? Is he: 
	- talking spiritually 
	- taking God’s name in vain
	- responding to an insult that he shoots blanks
Because he turns around and sleeps with her servant. 

The interaction of man with God, yet man seems to still doubt, cheat, and lie, and fear other men… what gives?

There are many similar stories. Are these to be viewed as parallel? Does parallel have meaning?

Are there two abimilechs? Both Abraham and Isaac tell Abimilech that their wives are their sisters
