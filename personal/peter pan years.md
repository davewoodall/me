I have often referred to my first 12 years of life as the Peter Pan years. We lived in Orlando, Florida in a neighborhood that was well insulated from traffic. So, we had free range of the streets, bushes, and surrounding woods.

We would play baseball and war around the block and all kinds of games. There were probably 50 other kids in the neighborhood that were around my age. It was not uncommon to bike over to David Franz’s house to plan nintendo. Play Legos with Kevin Lear. Play some G-rated version of Dungeons and Dragons at Steve Taylor’s house. Read Comic books at Tom O’briens. Play GI Joe’s At Armands House. Play baseball with the Mammon kids. Smoke cigarettes with with David Heart. And all sorts of other types of activities.

I also watched my share of tv. I probably watched every episode of Bewitched, f-troop, Gomer Pile, Andy Griffith, 321-contact, reading rainbow, price is right, and more. Then, when I was tired of those, I could always play some nintendo.

I spent so much time playing and could do whatever I wanted. Everything was within biking distance. The super market. The hobby store. The library. The baseball field. The YMCA. We would ride bikes to spring lake and spend hours there. Just me and a friend, cousin, brother, or combination of them all.

Calling them Peter Pan years was a tribute to the fun and freedom I had a child. But lately, I've relized they portray another part accurately. I have little to no memeories of my parents involvement in my life. Yes, I have memories of them in the peripheral. But, there was limited direct interaction with me.

My did give my brothers and myself one proactive talk. The 'Your mother and I stayed virgins before we were married and I admonish you to do the same'. Talks with Steve and Mike confirm that the conversation with Dad highly influenced all three of us to keep our virginity for marriage. Even if it was only in the most technical sense.

But, other than that any ongoing conversations with my father or mother about career, finances, college, education, growth, direction, purpose, talents, interests, being a gentleman, how to treat a woman, or living a life on purpose were not apart of my relationship with either of my parents.

I was a lost boy.

i  Is the next part necessary?

When I think back on that I have a few thoughts. First, I boast about how times were different and that we were safe to do those kinds of things. I can agree to that. But, I can also say that by the time I was in 5th grade, I was staying the night at the Bishop’s house who were probably 8 home schooled kids. During the sleep over, the kid my age asked me if I wanted to see something  and he opened a bottom dresser drawer and showed me his older brothers copy of playboy. I had never seen anything like that. It didn’t catch me at first because the the angle of the magazine was more in his favor. I never really thought to tell my parents about it. Then, I remember being allowed to spend the night with the Shelton’s when I was in 6th grade. If my memory serves me correctly, Eric’s father was an ex convict who was somehow allowed to have custody of his 3 kids. My parents didn’t seem to mind to let me spend the night with them. He didn’t seem to mind us watching R rated movies. They had HBO and whatever else and we would just stay up all through the night as unsupervised 6th graders and watch whatever came on.
