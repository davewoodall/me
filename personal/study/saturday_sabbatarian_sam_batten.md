This is an 87 page document primarily focusing on the issue of Lunar Solar weekly 7th day Sabbaths and whether they systematically fall on a papal Gregorian Calendar “Saturday” or not all 52 weeks during its yearly cycle.

Before I get into the main content of this important document there are several questions that need to be asked:

1.   Why is it that we SDAs are never told about how the Millerites, after March 21, 1843, [when Christ did not return to the earth as they were expecting, erroneously, yet quite honestly and quite sincerely thinking that the Cleansing of the earth by fire was what the Cleansing of the Heavenly Sanctuary process was all about], realized that they had somehow either misinterpreted the event or had make errors in their calculations as to when the projected event was to occur, restudied their positions concerning the Cleansing of the Sanctuary doctrine and discovered through studying and using the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar, [about which they received precise information from the Karaite Jews, the ONLY Jews that were still following the Biblical Lunar Calendar given to Moses and the Hebrews at the time of the Exodus] as to how the ancient Hebrews established New Moon Day for the month of Abib which began their Religious yearly cycle],  that the correct date for that event was NOT March 21, 1843 or March 21, 1844,  [as they had formerly believed and taughtduring the years 1842 to 1843], NOR Sept. 23, 1844 [where Worldwide Jewry had it pegged to have taken place that year], but to the contrary, was an event that was to take place on Oct. 22, 1844, based on a set of calculations related to the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar date for the Beginning of the Biblical Lunar Solar Religious Calendar Year which always begins with New Moon Day, Abib/Nisan 1?

When SDA Naysayers, who go to great lengths to try to refute the validity of the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar indicating in their documents, statements such as

“… the data in support of this idea is faulty. Various parts of it are either speculative, strained, inference-based, or uninspired. Whether approached Biblically or from the Testimonies, the idea has not stood up to scrutiny.” 

or indicating like some SDA “Saturday” Sabbatarian Naysayers and Non-SDA “Saturday” Sabbatarian Naysayers alike do, that it is a “Satanic Delusion” of these last days, or calling it “Damnable Heresy,” they are making these pejorative remarks about the Creator’s Calendar not realizing that (1) they are insulting the Creator of the Universe and of the 7th day Sabbath by condemning His Divinely established Calendar system which is the ONLY ONE His word ever uses with reference to all of His Worship Days listed in Lev. 23; and, by the same token they are also indirectly without realizing it, condemning our SDA Sanctuary Doctrine at the same time which doctrine is squarely based on that same Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar, placing it in the category of being a “Satanic delusion” and “Damnable Heresy,” seeing that it was precise calculations produced according this very calendar system that the Millerites used in the fall of 1843 and in the spring of 1844 to arrive at the correct date for the ending of the 2300 prophetic day prophecy of Dan. 8: 14, and for the initiation of the 2nd Phase of Christ’s Messianic Ministry – i.e., the Cleansing of the Heavenly Sanctuary. 

They all fail to realize that if the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar is esteemed as it is by many “Saturday” keeping SDAs and by “many “SDA Lunar Solar Yearly Feast Keepers“ to be a Satanic Delusion,” and “Damnable Heresy,” what does that say about the foundation of our SDA Sanctuary Doctrine that is based on the same Lunar Solar Calendar foundation? And what does that also say about their Loyalty the Creator of the Universe when out one side of their mouth, they cast total contempt upon His True Biblical Calendar, and out of the other side of their mouth, exalt the Gregorian Calendar, produced by Satan through Papal Rome, [the very power designated in Dan. 7: 25 as the Little Horn that would change or alter His True Calendar so that nobody would recognize when His True Worship days would occur, or on whose calendar system they should be kept].

It is a most curious phenomenon that the most vocal people within the 7th day Sabbatarian communities, who try to destroy the credibility and validity of the Creator’s True Calendar, are themselves, all systematic, compulsive, perpetual observers and promoters of the Papal Gregorian “Saturday” as if it were the Lord’s True Biblical 7th day Sabbath! Another group that do the same thing is the Hybrid Papal Gregorian-Calendar-oriented “Saturday” Sabbatarian-Lunar Solar Yearly Feast Keepers!

Here are both groups of sincerely, well-meaning, “Saturday” Sabbatarian people systematically decrying and trying to systematically undermine the Biblical validity of the concept of Lunar Solar Weekly Sabbaths, while at the same time illogically and inconsistently systematically promoting the validity of the Papal Antichrist System’s Gregorian Calendar as the ONLY TRUE SOURCE of the True Biblical 7th day Sabbath. Now isn’t that ironic, paradoxical, and totally hypocritical at the same time. Now if that’s NOT “a Satanic Delusion,” I don’t know what is. 

Who within the various 7th day Sabbatarian Camps is truly on the Lord’s side? Those who systematically promote His Cosmic Enemy’s “Counterfeit, Deceptive Papal Gregorian Calendar,” as the only true calendar to follow for His weekly 7th day Sabbaths, and who defame those who keep ALL of His Holy Days listed in Lev. 23 by His One True Lunar Solar Calendar, or those who choose to follow the true teachings of the Word of God on these issues? 

Everyone has to decide what the truth is on this issue for himself. What good is it if you claim to be a part of the alleged Corporate Remnant Church and then turn around and systematically follow Spiritual Babylon’s Gregorian Calendar, [which was NOT set up by Christ the Creator], for your religious affairs? Who are  you really fooling? You are certainly not fooling Christ because He knows exactly which side of these issue you are really on!

Most SDAs and Most other “Saturday” Sabbatarians fail to realize that they are religiously following “Satan’s Calendar,”  NOT “Christ’s Calendar” on these controversial issues. The sad thing is that for most of them its all about habit and tradition, not about whether what they are doing or practicing or believing is Biblically true or false. Most of the people that I have tried to talk to about these vitally important issues have a religion based on “assumptions,” and “preconceived ideas”.  Instead of studying to see if what they are believing is really the truth or error, they choose to ignore the truth and hold to the error contained in their preconceived ideas, the validity of which they have not verified or dare question!

2.   Why is the SDA Church not informing its membership of the secret meeting behind closed doors that took place during the years 1938-1939 when the General Conference set up a 9 member Research Committee to study a 283 page document written by an SDA Pastor, names J. H. Wierts in 1932, that they totally ignored and refused to study into until 1938-1939, that dealt with how the Millerites had discover -ed the correct date for the Biblical Day of Atonement procedure, also known in SDA circles as “the Cleansing of the Heavenly Sanctuary” that was to take place on the 10th day of the Biblical 7th month of Tishri based on the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar? 

Why is it that the SDA membership were never informed that the members of that special 9 person Research Committee realized that the Millerites findings by their use of the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar was correct regarding the timing of the Day of Atonement Event, and that the Lunar Solar Calendar was indeed the True Biblical Calendar that the SDA Church should have been following all along, and that the Committee was convicted of the correctness of that Biblical Calendar system and was almost at the point of adopting the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar as official Church Policy, but then got cold feet on the issue and shelved it, never mentioning or studying it again?

3.     Why is it that the SDA Church System has gone out of its way for many years since 1938-1939 to denigrate and try to explain away 99.99% of the Lord’s Worship Days all listed in His Worship Manual located in Lev. 23, which include His New Moon Worship Day, which is the 1st day of every Biblical month, and ALL of His Yearly Religious Festivals with their Holy Convocation Sabbaths which they denigrate as “Ceremonial Sabbaths” that they say were an integral part of the Ceremonial Law that was nailed to the cross, when the Spirit of Prophecy indicates clearly in G.C., p. 399, pars. 3-5, and in. Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 540-541, that they are all Typical and Prophetic in Nature having to do with certain aspects or stages of the Plan of Salvation, mentioning specifically in G.C., p. 399, par. 5 to p. 400, par. 1, and in P.P., pp. pp. 540-541 which passages indicate that the Fall Feasts are intimately connected with the events that are to take place JUST PRIOR TO the 2nd Advent of Christ, and thus being prophetic in nature, those FALL FEASTS that all take place during the Biblical 7th month of Tishri [i.e., the Feast of Trumpets [Tishri 1], the Day of Atonemment [Tishri 10] and the Feast of Tabernacles [that begins onTishri 15], have a definite role to play in the events to yet unravel just prior to the 2nd Advent. Hence, seeing that that is the case, their being propheticin nature, obviously means that those 3 FALL FEASTS could NOT POSSIBLY have been abolished at the Cross as part of the Ceremonial Law as our SDA Church has been erroneously teaching, now, for quite a number of years.

4.    Why is our SDA Church ONLY promoting the Biblical 7th day Sabbath, yet keeping it systematically all 52 weeks per year, NOT on the Lord’s True Biblically supported Lunar Solar Calendar System, but on the Papal Antichrist System’s Gregorian Calendar, a Calendar system that is ONLY 429 years old and doesn’t go back to either the 1st Century A.D., nor to the time of the Exodus, nor to Creation Week – a Calendar System that Satan caused the Church of Rome to instigate in Oct., 1582, the year that they totally switched the days of the Roman weekly cycle around from its former 1st Century B.C. to 1st Century C.E. “Saturday to Friday” weekday sequence, to their NEW INNOVATIVE “Sunday to Saturday” weekday sequence in order to support their False Propaganda Claims about the Biblical 7th day Sabbath being “Saturday,” and to support their False Propaganda Claims about their alleged “Friday/Saturday/Sunday” sequence for the Crucifixion day to Resurrection day scenario in the 1st Century A.D., when the Roman Calendar artifacts discovered in the 18th Century by Archeologists in Italy, clearly show that as both types of Roman Calendars that existed in the 1st Century C.E. had a perpetual “Saturday to Friday” sequence in them, not one of the 6916 to 6968 Roman weekly cycles during the 133 to 134 year timespan of the Roman Occupation of Palestine between the years 63 B.C. to C.E. 70, ever contained the “Sunday to Saturday” style weekday sequence that ONLY the Papal Gregorian Calendar launched in Oct., 1582 portrays, - the ONLY Roman Calendar in Roman Calendar history to ever portray that UNIQUE Roman weekday sequence, which clearly means that NOT EVEN ONE Roman weekly cycle all throughout the 133-134 year Roman Occupation of Palestine between the years 63 B.C. to 70 C.E., will lend support to the False Papal alleged “Friday/Saturday/Sunday” sequence for the Crucifixion day to Resurrection day scenario in the 1st Century A.D. This means that ALL of the Christian Churches need to rethink the underpinnings of their weekly day of worship which currently are all based on False Papal Roman Calendar propaganda Statements concerning events that never took place where or when they say that they took place!

5.    Why is our SDA Church system at the present time trying its best to discredit the True Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar, and trying to persuade SDAs that keeping the Lord’s Yearly Festivals with their collective accompanying 7 Yearly Holy Convocation Sabbaths is a counterproductive invalid activity in the 21st Century, insisting that those Biblical practices were only for the Ancient Jews and all ceased with the death of Christ on the Cross – a doctrine that clearly comes from the Catechism of the Catholic Counter-Reformation Council of Trent.

6.   Why is the SDA Church disfellowshipping Church members who believe in and who promote the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar and all of the Biblical Festivals with their accompanying Holy Convocation Sabbaths? Why does the SDA Church system HATE the Lord’s True Calendar and the majority of His Holy Days listed in Lev. 23, and why are they only choosing to systematically promote Papal Rome’s Counterfeit Gregorian Calendar – the very Calendar that prevents God’s professed people from ever discovering when the Lord’s True Holy Days listed in Lev. 23 are to occur in their Correct Timeslots?

7.    Why is it that SDA Church members HATE to have the Lord’s True Lunar Solar Calendar mentioned to them? Why is this topic so vitally important to their understanding of events leading up to the Great Final Crisis that is soon to come upon the earth like POISON to them? Why do they rise up in anger against it systematically condemning it as “a Satanic Delusion” or as “Damnable Heresy,” without even beginning to understand what the real issues of the case really are? This is a really curious phenomenon! It is most definitely a topic that Satan DOES NOT want the professed people of God in this last generation of earth’s history to understand! Therefore, it must contain something of vital importance to their well being that he wants to forever keep hidden from them! The strange thing, is that people who otherwise act so piously and claim to be true students of the Word of God, who claim the contents of the Bible as their Creed, totally reject even listening to anyone explain the Lord’s True Calendar which is the only one that the Bible supports! Their negative, prejudiced, totally paranoid attitude makes no logical or spiritual sense.

There is a lot of vitally new information on this controversial issue that was not included in any of my previous documents on this subject. Please read the entire document and fully digest it before trying to produce a rebuttal to it! You are going to learn a lot of amazing new things about the Gregorian Calendar in this document that you never knew before that will help clarify several issues in your mind, I do believe!

I want you to know that I am not on a vendetta against any of the people mentioned in this document. I am simply questioning some of their lines of reason-ing which are not sound, either Biblically or historically!

When I was at Terra Bella, in Oct., 2008 to give my series of 10 lectures on Biblical End-Time Prophecy, I knew absolutely nothing about the Biblical Lunar Solar Yearly cycle, nor about the yearly Festivals and their collective 7 accompany-ing Holy Convocation Sabbaths, NOR did I know anything at that time about WHAT actually constituted Christ’s Biblical Lunar Solar monthly cycle 4 weekly 7 day Sabbaths and how any of that works. I have learned a great deal about these issues due to 2 years of intensive Biblical Research and 2 years of accompanying historical research into the history of the evolution of Roman Calendars from the beginning of the history of the founding of the city of Rome in 753 B.C. to the inauguration of the Counterfeit Papal Gregorian Jesuit-produced Calendar in Oct., 1582.

In PK 678.002 [p. 678, par. 2 in the electronic version of that book] Ellen G. White indicates that all of the institutions given to Israel are to be restored by the Remnant People of God in the last days of earth’s history. However, as God never ever gave the Papal Gregorian 7th day position “Saturday” as found in its “Sunday to Saturday” 7 day weekly cycle – [a weekly cycle that never existed either during Creation Week, nor at the time of the Exodus, nor in the 1st Century when Christ Himself live and walked on the earth], as His 7th day Sabbath either to Adam or Eve at the beginning of Human History, or to the Hebrews when He was leading them up out of Egypt to the Promised Land of Canaan, or to the 1st Century Jews during the 133-134 years of the Roman Occupation of Palestine between the years 63 B.C. to 70 A.D., the Papal Gregorian weekday “Saturday,” that ALL of the 500+ Protest -ant 7th day Papal Gregorian Calendar-oriented “Saturday” Sabbatarians, includ-ing 99.99% of the 25+ million SDAs worldwide, are systematically erroneously choosing to observe as what they think the True Biblical 7th day Sabbath is, CANNOT POSSIBLY BE an integral part of “All of the institutions given to Israel” that God is going to restore among His people in the latter days of earth’s history, .

ALL the Institutions given to Israel are to be
Restored by the Remnant people of God.
PK.677.002 

“The spiritual restoration of which the work carried forward in Nehemiah's day was a symbol, is outlined in the words of Isaiah: "They shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities."

"They that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in." Isaiah 61:4; 58:12. 

PK.677.003 

“The prophet here describes a people who, in a time of general departure from truth and righteousness, are seeking to restore the principles that are the foundation of the kingdom of God. They are repairers of a breach that has been made in God's law--the wall that He has placed around His chosen ones for their protection, and obedience to whose precepts of justice, truth, and purity is to be their perpetual safeguard. 

PK.678.001 

“In words of unmistakable meaning the prophet points out the specific work of this remnant people who build the wall. "If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor Him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it." Isaiah 58:13, 14. 

PK.678.002 

“In the time of the end every divine institution is to be restored. The breach made in the law at the time the Sabbath was changed by man, is to be repaired. God's remnant people, standing before the world as reformers, are to show that the law of God is the foundation of all enduring reform and that the Sabbath of the fourth commandment is to stand as a memorial of creation, a constant reminder of the power of God. In clear, distinct lines they are to present the necessity of obedience to all the precepts of the Decalogue. Constrained by the love of Christ, they are to co-operate with Him in building up the waste places. They are to be repairers of the breach, restorers of paths to dwell in. See verse 12.”

In my former 27 page document on these controversial issues among SDAs and among the various conflicting Lunar Solar Calendar advocates who hold variant, conflicting, mutually exclusive views on these same issues, [i.e., conflicting views as to whether New Moon Day is to be determined by the sighting of the 1st Cresent or 1st Sliver of the New Moon that only becomes observable AFTER Conjunction day [when absolutely nothing visible can be seen in the sky], or about whether or not the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths which can ONLY truly occur within the framework of the Lord’s Lunar Solar monthly Construct],  seeing that the Creator of the Universe and of Planet Earth, and of the 7th day Sabbath, Christ Jesus, NEVER gave Humanity two separate calendars to follow from Creation Week, nor from the time of the Exodus, etc., [i.e., His Own Celestial Lunar Solar Calendar that is presented in His Worship Manual located in Lev. 23 + the Counterfeit Papal Gregorian Calendar [that didn’t come on the scene of history until the late 16th Century A.D., in Oct., 1582 to be precise], - an event that occurred [more than 4000 years AFTER Creation Week], by which He allegedly expects His Remnant people, Spiritual Israel in these last days of earth’s history [as ALL of the 500+ Protestant Papal Gregorian Calendar-oriented 7th day “Saturday Sabbatar-ians” no doubt claim to be], to Keep the Gregorian Jesuit-produced Counterfeit New Innovative “Saturday” that exists ONLY in their Counterfeit “Sunday to Saturday” modified Roman weekly cycle that used to be a “Saturday to Friday” weekly cycle when He Himself lived on the earth in the 1st Century A.D., [NEITHER of which Roman Calendar weekday construct is His True Lunar Solar 7 day weekly cycle] - so as to be able to keep His alleged “True weekly 7th day ‘Saturday’ Sabbath” according to, - a day that DID NOT EXIST when He lived on the earth for His True weekly 7th day Sabbath to Correspond to! 

As Jesus NEVER kept a 7th day of the week position Roman “Saturday” NOR a 7th day Sabbath on His own Lunar Solar Calendar system that could or would have corresponded to a Roman 7th day “Saturday” [that NEVER ONCE existed while He lived on the earth], He would clearly NOT have instructed Ellen G. White that this NON-EXISTENT alleged “Saturday,” [that didn’t exist in His day], and which ONLY EXISTS on the calendar that Satan, [His Cosmic Rival and Archenemy caused the papal System to produce in Oct., 1582], is His TRUE BIBLICAL WEEKLY 7th day Sabbath! The very idea that He did so, is Blasphemy of the highest order!

Bible Students are right about the Names of the 4th month of Tammuz and the 5th month of Av/ab, being names of pagan Babylonian origin. So is the name of the 7th month of Tishri of pagan  Babylonian origin, but, then,  so are 8 of the other 12 names of the Biblical Calendar which names are actually recorded in the Bible: 

Nisan: - (Neh. 2: 1;Esther 3: 7)

Sivan (Esther 8: 9)

Elul = 6th month (see Neh. 6: 15)

Chesvan = 8th month (I Kg. 6: 38)

  Kislev/Chisleu (Zech. 7: 1) = 9th month

  Tevet (Esther 2: 16) = 10th month

  Shebat or Sebat (Zech. 1: 7) = 11th month.

  Adar (Esther 3: 7) = 12th month.

  In fact, , if you really want to get technical on this issue, Only the month 1st month of Abib, the 2nd  month of Zif, the 7th month of Ethanim, and the 8th month of Bul are of Hebrew or Aramaic origin. 

  There are two sets of names for 4 of the 12 Biblical months of the Bible: 

  (1)   All 12 Biblical months have a set of Babylonian names [which names are obviously of pagan Babylonian origin]. Their Babylonian names are Nisan, Iyar, Sivan, Tammuz, Av, Elul, Tishri, Kheshvan, Kislev, Tevet, Shevet, Adar. 

  (2)   Only 4 Babylonian monthly names have Hebrew name equivalents: Abib, Zif, Ethanim and Bul. These are specifically mentioned by name in certain Biblical texts such as: 

  Hebrew Name                                  Babylonian name:

Abib: - Ex. 13: 4                           Nisan (Esther 3: 7)

  Zif : - (see I Kg. 6: 1)                    Iyar [name not mentioned in the Bible]

  Ethanim in I Kg. 8: 2                    Tishri [name not mentioned in the Bible]

“Bul” in I Kg. 6: 38)                      Marchesvan or Chesvan (I Kg. 6: 38)

  Students of the Biblical Calendar have clearly noted that the Biblical calendar is not the same as the Gregorian/Roman/Worldly one. Unfortunately, many of them don’t seem to see the vital importance of that difference when dealing with Religious matters. 

  Those in the work force have to deal with the Gregorian Calendar of totally pagan origin. Unless people are at pension age and on a pension already, or have their own job, keeping the True Biblical Lunar Solar Weekly Sabbaths would be their worst nightmare financially! 

  Sooner or later, however,  when the New World Calendar comes on stream they will be forced to make a permanent decision for or against the Lord’s True Lunar Solar Weekly Sabbaths and that decision will be the FINAL POLARIZING event that will place them either in the Lord’s True Camp KEEPING ALL of His Holy days including His weekly 7th day Lunar Solar Calendar 7th day Sabbaths, as well as all of His other Holy Days that are to be systematically kept by that same Lunar Solar Calendar as described in detail in Lev. 23, or they won’t withstand the Financial Pressure and will eventually CAVE IN due to fear of losing everything: their job, their house that is under mortgage, the vehicule, the ability to send their kids to school/college/university, the ability of receive medical attention, to obtain Medical, house, car insurance, the ability to be able to license and service their vehicule, the ability to be able to have hot and cold running water, the ability to provide food for their table, etc., - all TRUE LITERAL VERY REAL CONCERNS, and not being able to deal with these financial pressures they will eventually Polarize themselves into Satan’s Camp! 

  According to the Spirit of Prophecy, there is NO RETURNING to The Lord’s Camp once the die is cast, and you have polarized yourself into Satan’s Camp in order to save your life, your property, your job, your financial sustenance which will at some future time, despite your best efforts to stave it off, will be totally removed and you won’t have 1 penny of income coming in, let alone $30,000 to $50,000 or more that some SDAs take in per year at the present time. If you are judging the truthfulness of Lunar Solar weekly Sabbaths based on whether or not it will impact your financial well being and produce for you a living financial nightmare, most likely you will keep on doing what you are doing now in order to avoid those unpleasant issues in the future!

  Some people look at the differences between the Biblical Calendar versus our current secular Gregorian Calendar. Some people see this issue as merely a similarity between living on a border between two time zones.  One learns to coordinate as their life requires it.  A monthly cycle isn't necessarily the only cycle we must use and follow. That may be true, but as we live in a Gregorian Calendar Controlled Society, there are more issues involved here than just following a certain monthly cycle or a certain calendar. Some Christians are followers and keepers of two separate calendar systems both of which they attempt to keep, but only keep them partially when it is convenient and produces no negative effects or negative repercussions to their lifestyle or financial, social, or emotional well-being. For some of these people the weekly cycle and which one they have chosen to keep dramatically affects many aspects of their life.
   
  The controversy over the weekly 7th-Day Sabbath, though it is similar to YHWH’s other 7's, such as in the 7th Sabbatical year when the land is to lay fallow and not be used and the 7 Juliblee cycles, that involve 7 complete 7 year cycles that amounts to 49 years or 7 x 7 year cycles + 1 additional year which is Jubilee are not to be confused by analogy with His 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths that occur monthly, all 12-13 months of the year depending whether the year is a regular Biblical year of 12 months contained 48 weekly cycle, or a Biblical Lunar Solar Leap Year of 13 months containing a total of 52 weekly cycles. To confuse these issues by comparing them by analogy is not wise because they operate differently and for a different purpose. To treat them as being identical in nature created confusion and totally muddies the waters when dealing with the Calendar controversy under discussion.

  We have to live in a Gregorian Calendar controlled world. That is the problem. We are all Pilgrims in an Unholy Land that is under the Control of the Enemy and under the control of the Counterfeit Calendar System that he egged his Counterfeit Church on earth, Papal Rome, to institute in Oct., 1582.  That is a fact that we all will have to deal with realistically, [even those of us surviving on Social Assistance, or those of us who are on Pension], when the financial crunch comes to our doorstep as it eventually will. It is only a matter of time!

  Our Financial interests will be in conflict with the Word of God if we compromise in the keeping any of the Lord’s Holy Days found in Lev. 23 in order to prosper financially. 

  99.99% of the 25+ million SDAs KNOW ABSOLUTELY nothing about this issue as yet, but they will as time goes on and the last warning message goes out to the world at large. 

  I believe that 99+ % will walk away from the Biblical Calendar when any or all of their keeping of the Lord’s True Holy Days found in Lev. 23 are called into question as employers become more and more stringent and hostile and as the law of the land takes the side of the employer. 

  The time will come, when if you will stand up for ALL of the Lord’s Holy Days listed in Lev. 23 and are determined to follow them all of them according to His True Lunar Solar Calendar, you won’t have 2¢ to rub together when the time comes, and you will see all earthly financial support cut off if you don’t go over to the Sunday keeping camp! 

  If this is a major concern for you, personally, and I know it will be at some future time, [I can empathize with you on this issue because I know that it is a real genuine concern that could dramatically affect your lifestyle and possible livelihood, etc.], then you may need to revise your thinking about the Work Force and see if there is any way that you have a set of skills that will permit you to have or operate your own viable business. Otherwise, even if you were a worker for the SDA Church System, they most likely would “give you the boots” if you ever decided to keep the Lord’s True weekly Sabbath as it should be kept according to the dictates of His Lunar Solar Calendar. 

  Already in the USA, in many states, people are being systematically excommunicated from the SDA Church, not because of Homosexuality, Lesbianism, stealing, immorality, adultery, or some other openly known sin, but because they believe in and practice the Yearly Biblical Festivals with their Holy Convocation Sabbaths. The SDA Church systematically teaches against ALL of the Lord’s Worship Days listed in Lev. 23 except for the concept of the 7th day being the Biblical Sabbath, which, though they claim to be keeping it, are nevertheless, unknowingly, systematically keeping it on the wrong day most of the year because they are attempting to keep it on the Wrong Calendar.

  How long do you think they would be able to remain in the employ of the SDA Church System or any secular employer, for that matter, if they also adopted the Biblical Truth that the Lord’s weekly 7th day Sabbaths,  like all of the other Worship Days in the Lord’s Worship Manual found in Lev. 23, are determined by His Lunar Solar Calendar and must be kept in harmony with that Calendar system when our SDA Church System and most all other church systems are totally against the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar and all of its aspects and are disfellowshipping people who are vocal about it and refuse to shut up and be silent and tow the line like good little Papist SDAs that the majority of our SDA people presently are without realizing it? 

  Right now, you may be a traditional “Saturday” Sabbatarian, or you could be a Lunar Solar yearly Feast/Holy Convocation Sabbath keeper who is also systematically keeping what you currently believe to be the True Biblical 7th day Sabbath according to the Papal System’s Counterfeit Gregorian weekly cycle! 

  I don’t know how long you have been an 7th day Sabbatarian,odr what your former or current religious background is! Nor do I know anything about just how long you have been a Lunar Solar Calendar Biblical year Feast/Holy Convocation Sabbath keeper or how you got on that route if you happen to be in some branch of the Lunar Solar Camp. 

  If you believe in and practice the Biblical Lunar Calendar yearly Biblical Feasts with their accompanying 7 yearly Holy Convocation Sabbaths, at least you have “two proverbial wheels on the right proverbial tracks!” That is a plus! 

  Neverthekess,  it may be that you don’t yet fully understand the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar and how it works, especially if you insist on NOT following the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar for the keeping of the Lord’s 4  weekly 7th day Sabbaths per month even though they clearly operate, according to Scripture, within the confines of His Lunar Solar Calendar Construct as is plainly seen from Ex. 16 and Jn. 19:  14, 30-31 for those who have the “spiritual discernment” to see it and are not too stubborn and obstinate, due to their personal biases and personal prejudices to see it, believe it, or to practice it.

  Many Lunar Solar Calendar Biblical Feast/Holy Convocation Sabbath Keepers fail to realize, that when Christ gave the Moral Law and His 7th day Sabbath to the Hebrews during the 3 Biblical month of Sivan, He had already showed the Hebrews HOW His Lunar Solar Calendar operates and HOW His 4 weekly Lunar Solar Calendar 7th day Sabbaths per month also operate, with the Manna Miracle demonstration.

  People who are Saturday Sabbatarians, and people who are Lunar Solar Calendar Feast/Holy Convocation Sabbath keepers often misuse and misinterpret the 4th Commandment to mean that “we are to work 6 days and rest on the 7th day as the Sabbath” but try to place the keeping of that 4th Commandment OUTSIDE the JURISDICTION and CONFINES of the Lunar Solar Calendar Construct that He obviously placed them in as revealed in Ex. 12, 16, 19 and in Lev. 23 and in Jn. 19: 14, 30-31. 

  Many Lunar Solar Feast Keepers/Holy Convocation Sabbath Keepers are so desperate to grasp after straws so that they won’t have to believe in the Lord’s 4 weekly Lunar Solar Sabbaths, [which obviously CANNOT logically or temporally BE OTHERWISE as they are integral, internal component parts of a complete unit of time called “a Lunar Solar Month,” of which there are clearly ONLY TWO TYPES: 29 day months and 30 day month,s [there being NO SUCH THING as 28 or 31 day months anywhere in the word of God], which same Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar they otherwise profess to actually believe in and to practice the Biblically Lunar Solar Feast Keepers/Holy Convocation Sabbaths according to, during the three specific Biblical months of Abib/Nisan, Sivan, and Tishri where and when they actually occur and during which months only they can and are to be kept.

  What amazes me is that they have no problem believing in and observing those Lunar Solar Feast Keepers/Holy Convocation Sabbaths that they know from the Word of God ONLY OCCUR during those 3 specitic Biblical Lunar Solar months of Abib/Nisan, Sivan, and Tishri, which they ALSO KNOW do NOT OCCUR anywhere on our Papal Gregorian Calendar, yet, though they claim to be followers of the True Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar system, systematically refuse to keep the Lord’s weekly Lunar Solar Sabbaths based on the same principles that govern ALL of  the integral internal workings of that Same Lunar Solar Calendar. It CANNOT BE OTHERWISE, or else the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar is a sham as is any attempt to claim to be following it when one follows it religiously ONLY PART of the time when it is convenient to do so and doesn’t create any personal, social, emotional, or financial problems to do so!

  If you can’t even distinguish between truth and error on these religious issues NOW, before the crisis comes, and if you are prepared to compromise now on this Biblical weekly Sabbath issue and are determined to remain keeping the wrong day of the week per month on the wrong calendar construct all year, the chances are that you will agree to cave into the Powers that be and will cease to follow the Lord 100% as far as His worship days are concerned when the FINAL TESTING comes! 

  Most 7th day Sabbatarians are only half-following the Lord on these issues as it is, as is our greatly esteemed brother John Vandenburg, Melody Drake, Shauna Manfredine, Carl Bagster, Brian Hoeck, Lew White, Tim McHyde, and a whole host of SDA and Non-SDAs who are ONLY keeping His yearly Festivals with their yearly Holy Convocation Sabbaths, by His True Lunar Solar Calendar, while keeping His most important weekly day of worship on a Counterfeit Calendar all 52 weeks per year where they see “Saturday” depicted on it because they sincerely believe that “Saturday” is the true Bible Sabbath – mainly because of statements made by Ellen G. White on the subject, and due to the false, misleading reason-ings of Naysayers who themselves DO NOT keep the True Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar-based weekly 7th day Sabbaths  – whose present inconsist-ent practices are NOT based on any Biblical support for it, because there is absolutely NO Biblical support for a perpetual “Saturday” that the majority of the “Saturday” keepers erroneously allege goes all the way back to Creation Week because they have themselves believing in the myth of an endless cycle of end-to-end weeks as Melody Drake and Shauna Manfredine, Carl Baxter, Elder John Vandenburg, Sandy Clark, and a host of other SDAs, have erroneously accepted as pure Gospel Truth!

  While I agree that the Papal Gregorian and the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar are indeed, totally different, let us get a little more precise on just HOW REALLY DIFFERENT they actually are, and whether that really matters or not. This is really very interesting:

  1.   The Biblical Lunisolar Calendar has only two types of months: 29 day months and 30 day months.

  a.    The 29 day months are: Iyar [also called Zif (see I Kg. 6: 1) ] = 2nd month; Tammuz = 4th month; Elul = 6th month; Chesvan = 8th month (also called “Bul” in I Kg. 6: 38) [can be a 30 day month during Leap Year]; Tevet (Esther 2: 16) = 10th month; Adar = the 12th month (Esther 3: 7). 

  b.    The 30 day months are: Abib/Nisan (Ex. 13: 4;Neh. 2: 1;Esther 3: 7) = 1st month; Sivan (Esther 8: 9) = 3rd month; Av/Ab = 5th month; Tishri/ Tisri (also known as Ethanim in I Kg. 8: 2)  = 7th month; Kislev/Chisleu (Zech. 7: 1) = 9th month [can be a 30 day month during Leap Year]; Shebat or Sebat (Zech. 1: 7) = 11th month.

  2.    NONE of these Biblical or Babylonian names for the months are found in any of the Roman Calendar Systems, neither in 

  a.   the 1st Century 7 day Planetary Week Astrological Calendar that didn’t come on stream as a separate Roman Calendar format until somewhere between the years 19 B.C. to 4 A.D. during the latter years of the Reign of Augustus Caesar.

  b.  nor in the 1st Century 8 day Julian Nundinal Calendar which began to be enforced by Julius Caesar in 45 B.C.

  c.    nor in the Papal Gregorian Calendar that didn’t see the light of day until Oct., 1582.

  3.     Equally NONE of the Roman monthly names of January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December exist either in the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar. So obviously we are dealing with two totally different calendar systems.

  4.   The Roman Calendar systems between the years 45 B.C. to 1582 A.D. have three types of months:

  a.   one 28 day month:  February; 

  b.    four 30 day months - April, June, September, November; and 

  c.    seven 31  day months: January, March, May, July, August, October, and December.

  5.     Other key differences:

  a.    The Biblical Religious Year begins with the month of Abib/Nisan, the 1st Biblical month of the Biblical Religious year, which in most years corresponds to April the 4th month of the Roman Civil year. Thus there is a time differential of 4 months between when the two types of calendar system years begin.

  b.    The Roman yearly cycle has ONLY a perpetual 12 month yearly cycle containing a perpetual 52 weeks. The Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar, on the other hand has two types of yearly cycles:

  i.   A regular year [which is most years] during which it ONLY contains 48 weeks.

  ii   A Biblical Leap Year [which ONLY occurs once every 3rd Biblical year], in which the Biblical year has a total of 13 months comprised of a total of 52 weeks. This phenomenon ONLY occurs ONCE every 3rd Biblical year. 

  Consequently, in view of this undeniable historical fact, IN ALL Gregorian years, [whether you realize this or not], that DO NOT correspond to “a Biblical Leap Year,” the Gregorian Calendar [like ALL Roman Calendars that have existed between the years 45 B.C. to Oct., 1582], has 4 weeks TOO MANY in them which correspond to absolutely nothing comparable in the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar. Those 4 extra Gregorian Calendar weeks per year, are OUTSIDE of the Parameters of the Lord’s True Lunar Solar Calendar System – the ONLY Calendar system which His Word supports from Gen. 1: 1 to Rev. 22: 21.

  During those 4 extra weeks per year, that the Roman Calendars, such as our Papal Gregorian Calendar has always had [which Gregorian Calendar we have all been using in North America for the last 391 years since it came to the shores of American in Plymouth Massachusetts, brought over by the Protestant Pilgrim Fathers in 1620 who were seeking Religious and political Asylum from Religious persecution from their various countries of origin in Western Europe] – “NOT ONE” of those extra 4 Papal Gregorian Calendar 7th day “Saturdays” can ever possibly be the Lord’s True weekly 7th day Sabbath, , simply because they FALL OUTSIDE of “the 48 weeks per year parameter” of which the Lord’s True Lunar Solar Calendar is comprised in ALL regular 12 month Biblical Lunar Solar yearly cycles. I don’t know whether you have been made aware of this fact before or not! If not you sure will be if you completely read this vitally important document!

  ONLY during a Biblical Leap year, ONCE every 3rd year, does both the Papal Gregorian Calendar [that we are all presently using] contain the same exact number of weeks as the Biblical Lunar Solar year. It was the same with the 4 types of Roman Calendar that existed between 45 B.C. to 1582. The Roman Calendar systems from 45 B.C. to 1582 have ALWAYS only had a 12 month cycle that contain -ed a total of 52 weeks. None of them ever had a 13th month yearly cycle! The Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar achieves this phenomenon only once every 3 Biblical year when it has an additional 13th 29 day month Ve-Adar added at the end of its yearly cycle which also gives it an extra 4 weekly cycles making a total of 52 weeks.
  The ONLY calendar that we in North America have ever known is the Papal Gregorian Calendar that is ONLY 429 years old as of this year, coming on stream ONLY in Oct., 1582 – NEVER having existed prior to that point in time in Roman Calendar history, which clearly means, , that the Papal Gregorian Calendar clearly DOES NOT go back to the 1st Century A.D., when Jesus and His disciples were alive in Palestine, NOR to the time of the Exodus, NOR does it go back to Creation Week!  Consequently, ALL who think that the Papal Gregorian Calendar is the True Biblical Creation Calendar are simply deceiving themselves!

  iii   Even though the Papal Antichrist System’s Gregorian Calendar has the same number of 52 weeks that the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar has once every 3rd Biblical year, there is another vitally important factor that ALL who decry the concept of Lunar Solar Calendar Weekly 7th day Sabbaths as “a Satanic Delusion” of these last days of earth’s history or as “Damnable Heresy,” need to know, and that  is the fact that while there are seven 31  day months:  January, March, May, July, August, October,  and December,  5 of our Papal Gregorian months: four of which are 31 day months: January, July, October, and December and one 30 day month: April, ALL have the peculiar phenomenon of having 5 consecutive “Saturdays” in them that ALL “Saturday” Sabbatarians - [including the majority of the 25+ million SDAs worldwide] - systematically observe as the weekly Biblical 7th day Sabbath without ever realizing that one of those 5 Saturdays in each of those 5 months just mentioned CANNOT POSSIBLY BE a true Biblical 7th day Sabbath, even if “Saturday” were the True Biblical Sabbath. 

  The reason is that there is NO SUCH THING and NEVER HAS BEEN such a thing as 5 consecutive weekly 7th day Sabbaths in any True Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar monthly cycle. That, my friend, is an indisputable fact. Just look at your Papal Gregorian Calendar, and you will see that what I have just told you is the absolute truth!

  In our day, ONLY “the Counterfeit Papal Gregorian Calendar system” has this peculiar “ANTI-BIBLICAL CALENDAR” phenomenon! This is a clear proof, , that our current Papal Gregorian Calendar – [the ONLY Calendar system we have ever known in North America since 1620], is clearly NOT the True Biblical Calendar, and that the Lord’s True weekly 7th day Sabbath DOES NOT systematic-ally occur on “Saturday” – in the 7th day position where it  ALWAYS occurs and has always occurred in the Satanically orchestrated Papal Gregorian Calendar since Oct., 1582, but which the Roman 1st Century B.C./A.D. Calendar Artifacts dated by Archeologists between the years 84 B.C. to 81 A.D. clearly show DID NOT exist in that same Papal Gregorian 7th weekday timeslot in either of the three types of Roman Calendar: the Republican Nundinal Calendar from 84 B.C. to 47 B.C.; the Julian 8 day Nundinal Calendar from 46 B.C. and onward during those two centuries of Roman/Jewish history and the Roman 7 day Planetary Astrological calendar dating from 19 B.C. and unward until 321 A.D. 

  The reasons are very simple, :

  1.   Nobody during either the 1st Century B.C. or A.D. ever heard of the Papacy and its late 16th Century A.D. Gregorian Calendar [that would have a “Sunday to Saturday” sequence to its weekly cycles]. Make a mental note of that fact!

  2.   The two Roman Calendar constructs for the 1st Century A.D. had a “Saturday to Friday” weekday sequence that transpired within the 8580 to 8632 Roman weekly cycles during 165-166 year span of time between 84 B.C. to 81 A.D. [which included the 6916 to  6968 Roman Weekly cycles that transpired during the 133 to 134 years of the Roman Occupation of Palestine between the years 63 B.C. to 70 A.D. 

  Curiously, NONE of the Anti-Lunar Solar Calendar weekly Sabbath Nay-sayers ever mention these historical facts! What are they hiding, or do they just NOT realize these historical facts? 

  During all of those weekly cycles just mentioned NOT ONE weekly 7th day “Saturday” ever existed! Thus there is a black hole of 8580 to 8632 totally NON-EXISTENT “alleged” 7th day “Saturday” Sabbaths during that comprehensive 165-166 year period between 84 B.C. to 81 A.D. 

  Most SDAs and most of the 500+ Protestant Papal Gregorian Calendar-oriented “Saturday” Sabbatarian Church systems have never heard of these histor-ical facts related to the number of Roman weekly cycles during the historical span of 165-166 years of Roman/Jewish history that took place between the years 84 B.C. to A.D. 81 during which there was NO “Dies Saturnis” = “Saturday” found in any of the 8580 to 8632 Roman weekly cycles that could have ever corresponded to the Biblical 7th day Sabbath that the Jews were keeping during that same time span! 

  This is a vitally important point, because ALL “Saturday” Sabbatarian 21st Century professing Christians simply “ASSUME” that the Jews ALWAYS kept the same “Saturday”  Sabbath that they all keep today, not realizing that their current alleged “Saturday” Sabbath is NOT Biblically supported, Nor is it historically supported because it is the sole product of the Counterfeit Papal Gregorian Jesuit-produced Gregorian Calendar that Satan had the leaders of Papal Rome invent in Oct., 1582. 

  That particular Papal Gregorian Calendar Construct has NO HISORY that goes back beyond Oct. 1582, which means that it is ONLY 429 years old, yet Millions of Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox Christians believe it to be the True Creation Calendar which it simply cannot possibly be. Such has been the effect of 429 years of Papal False Propaganda programming on the Sabbath to Sunday controversy that is still raging even among SDAs today.

  The Jews were only under the control of Pagan Rome from 63 B.C. to 70 A.D.  During all that span of weeks, NOT ONE weekly Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar 7th day weekly Sabbath EVER CORRESPONDED TO a Roman “Dies Saturnis” = the day we all know as “Saturday” in the 7th day position where we see it displayed today in the Papal Roman Calendar weekly cycles that did not exist back in the 1st Century B.C. or A.D. WHY NOT? It is because throughout the 133 to 134 years of the Roman Occupation of Palestine between the years 63 B.C. to 70 A.D., the Jews were observing ALL of their Worship Days/Ritual Days/Holy or Set Apart Days including their 7th day Weekly Lunar Solar Sabbaths according to the Lord’s Worship Manual located in Lev. 23 and  NOT according to either of the Roman Calendars during that same time span, NONE of which had “Saturday” in any of their weekly cycles. The Jews could not keep their weekly Sabbath on a day that COULD NOT correspond to a NON-EXISTENT 7th day Roman Saturday. It’s just that plain and simple. If Only the “Saturday” Sabbatarians could realize that there was NO “Saturday” to be kept where we see it today in our current Papal Gregorian Calendars UNTIL Oct., 1582, they might eventually begin to see the light.

  The Jews were clearly NOT using either of the two Roman Calendars: the 7 day Planetary Astrological Calendar or the 8 day Julian Nundinal Calendar for their worship practices, and even if the 7th day of the Biblical Lunar Solar Weekly Cycle, corresponded to the 7th day of the week position of one of the two Roman Calendars [which it did periodically, just like it does today], it WOULD NEVER have been possible for it to have CORRESPONDED TO a Roman 7th day “Saturday,” simply because both Roman Calendars in the 1st Century perpetually had the Roman day “Dies Veneris” = “Venus’ Day” = what we know as “Friday” in the 7th day position of their calendar weeks up until Oct., 1582, when the Papal System, at the instigation of Satan, switched the order of the days of the Roman Julian Calendar cycle around from its historic “Saturday to Friday” sequence, to their NEW INNOVATIVE “Sunday to Saturday” sequence which we still have today – the ONLY Roman calendar in Roman history that can lend support to their 3 levels of False deceptive Propaganda on the Sabbath to Sunday Controversy.

  The three levels of False Propaganda on this Sabbath to Sunday issue are as follows:

  A.  Level One:  that the Crucifixion Week Scenario took place in a Friday, Saturday, Sunday sequence in a Roman Calendar back in the 1st Century A.D. 

  ALL of “the Sunday keeping” Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox Churches believe this 1st level of Papal False Propaganda on this subject as do ALL of the 500+ Protestant Papal Gregorian Calendar-oriented “Saturday” Sabbatarian Churches including our own SDA Church System, as well as ALL of the Hybrid Papal Gregorian Calendar “Saturday” Sabbatarians [who ONLY use the Gregorian Calendar because they think they find the True Biblical Sabbath on it due to “Saturday” systematically falling on the 7th day of the Gregorian weekly cycle – a position that it never occupied at any previous time in Roman history], while at the same time inconsistently using the Lord’s ONLY True Calendar – His Lunar Solar Calendar – the ONLY Calendar supported by the Word of God, the Bible, from Gen. 1: 1 to Rev. 22: 11, in order to locate NEW MOON DAY so that they can find out when the Biblical Month begins relative to the transposition of the True Biblical New Moon Day over to the Gregorian Calendar in order to subsequently locate when ALL of the Lord’s Yearly Religious Festivals with their 7 collective accomp-anying Holy Convocation Sabbaths [ALL set out as to their timing, such as in which months of the year and in which weeks during the 3 specific Biblical Lunar Solar months, Abib/Nisan, Sivan, and Tishri], His Yearly Feasts begin and end. 

  They may be “claiming” to live by the True Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar, but in reality, they only live by it PARTIALLY during three specific months of the year: Abib/Nisan, Sivan, and Tishri]. The rest of the year, they live by Papal Rome’s Counterfeit Gregorian Calendar, patting themselves on the back about how piously they are keeping the Biblical weekly 7th day Sabbath while keeping it most of the year according to Satan’s devised “Papap Gregorian Calendar” that was NOT set up by Christ the Creator of the Universe, and of Planet Earth and the Creator of His True Biblical Celestial Lunar Solar Calendar, but set up by His Spiritual enemy organization on earth, Papal Rome. It is amazing just how spiritually blind SDAs and other Protestant Saturday Sabbatarians are on this issue who systematically rise up against the Lord’s true Calendar and against His True Lunar Solar weekly 7th day Sabbaths without even knowing any of the facts related to the case. 

  B.    Level II:  That the Bible allegedly enforces and the Jews have been enforcing a 7th day “Saturday” Sabbath for thousands of years, which the Catholic Church alleges to have changed from “Saturday” to Sunday.

  Where did they get that alleged Biblical “Saturday” Sabbath that they claim to have changed to “Sunday”? Have you ever seen “Saturday” mentioned anywhere in Scripture? Obviously not because it isn’t there anywhere so they couldn’t have gotten that false Propaganda claim from the Bible content anywhere. They had to have based it on their own Counterfeit Gregorian Calendar system.

  C.   Level III:  That “Sunday” the Papal “alleged” 1st day of the Roman weekly cycle in the 1st Century A.D. was Christ’s resurrection day, and that Christ at His death changed the Papal “alleged” day of worship from “Saturday” to “Sunday” and that the Christians thereafter kept “Sunday” instead of “Saturday” as their new weekly day of worship!

  There was NO Roman 7th day “Saturday” in the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar that the Jews were “alleged by Papal Rome” to have been keeping in the 1st Century A.D. during Crucifixion Week, that they allege in some of their contradictory statements that He changed to “Sunday,” the 1st Day of the Roman weekly cycle by His death on the cross. Christ could NOT change a Hebrew NON-EXISTENT “Saturday” into “Sunday,” for neither “Saturday,” NOR “Sunday” are Biblical week day name constructs, and though both of those Roman week day name construct did in fact exist in both the 1st Century B.C. and A.D., they clearly DID NOT EXIST where Papal Rome insists they occurred. It wants to make people believe that “Friday” was the 6th day of the Roman Weekly cycle, that  “Saturday” was the 7th day of the Week, and that “Sunday” was the 1st day of the week in the Roman weekly cycles back in the 1st Century A.D. – a weekday layout phenomenon that clearly NEVER EXISTED historically until Papal Rome produced its Counter-feit Gregorian Calendar in Oct., 1582.

  Let me spell out the Biblical/historical truth for you in even more precise detail, so that you can see and understand these controversial issues more clearly:

  The Biblical Support for Lunar Solar Weekly 7th day Sabbaths for those who claim that that concept is NON-Biblical Pagan Babylonian Concept related to the worship of the Summerian-Akkadian-Babylonian Moon god “Sin,” or a “Satanic Delsion” and/or “Damnable Heresy”:

  Bear with me on this, even though what I am about to present may NOT be what you presently Believe on this Controversial Issue! Follow the Logic and the Biblical/Historical Evidence!

  1.    Passover occurs on the 14th of Abib or Nisan, and that 1st Biblical Lunar Solar month is a 30 day month.

  2.   As Passover takes place on the 14th day of the 30 day 1st Biblical month of Abib/ Nisan, that Biblical Lunar Solar monthly date obviously occurs near the end of the 2nd Lunar Solar weekly cycle, for Jn. 19: 14, 42 clearly states, that Christ was “Cruci -fied on Preparation Day,” and we know from the context of Ex. 16 that the 6th day of the week, [during which 6 days Manna fell from heaven at sunrise and was collected until noon each day by the Hebrews, with a double portion collected on the 6th day], was “Preparation Day] as is clearly shown to have been the case in Ex. 16: 5, 22-29. NO knowledgeable SDA or any other knowledgeable 7th day Sabbatarian can truthfully deny that Biblical fact without distorting the Scriptures in Ex. 16.

  Note: Nevertheless, a whole raft of Lunar Solar Feast Keepers, (who do not want to admit that the 4 Lunar Solar Weekly cycles with their 4 Lunar weekly 7th day Sabbaths that occur in the 7th day position of each of those 4 weekly cycles are governed by their position relative to New Moon Day, purposely quibble over certain texts in that Biblical passage, simply because they do not want to believe that the Lord’s 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths always occur on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days of each of His Lunar Solar monthly cycles that are each made up of 4 Lunar Solar Weekly cycles [NOT 5], each containing 7 lunar solar days, which 7 day  lunar solar weekly cycles logically ends with a lunar solar weekly 7th day Sabbath. It cannot be otherwise. They can quibble all they want, but in doing so, they have to distort the Biblical text to sustain their chronic incredulity.

      Nevertheless, despite all of their senseless quibbling [over whether or not the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths in each Lunar Solar month are determined by their position in the month relative to Biblical New Moon Day], they do amazingly all agree that “Preparation Day” in Ex. 16, is indicated as being the 6th day of the Biblical 7 day weekly cycle on which a double portion of manna was to be collected and baked into bread or cakes, and all food preparations to be made for the following day, which was the 7th day Sabbath, [see Ex. 16: 5, 22-29]. 

      Now chronic quibblers [like Melody Drake and Shauna Mnafredine and a host of other SDAs, [as well as Feast Keeping NON-SDAs], may choose to quibble about this too, saying “but the Bible makes no mention of the term “Preparation day” in Ex. 16. That is true. It doesn’t mention that exact phrase or term, but the inherent, internal, immediate context, clearly shows that the 6th day of the Biblical Lunar Solar Weekly cycle is indeed “Preparation Day,” whether we want to quibble over the “exact phraseology” in the Biblical text or not, as ALL of the Naysayers love to do, to make a point. 

      Hence, Passover Day, Abib/Nisan 14, is “the Preparation Day” for the follow-ing day, Abib/Nisan 15, which day of the 15th , is clearly the 7th day of that 2nd Biblical Lunar Solar weekly cycle in that 1st Lunar Solar month, which clearly indicates that Abib/Nisan 15 is indeed the 2nd Biblical Lunar Solar weekly Sabbath for that 1st Biblical month, whether you wish to admit that to be true or deny its truth. 

      Hence, it should be obvious to all thinking, rational, 21st Century SDAs, that the Apostle John, in Jn. 19: 13, 30-31, is NOT describing an event [in the Roman 4th month of April, or any other Roman month], but is clearly describing an event taking place from the Biblical Lunar Calendar perspective, [seeing that there is NO such month as Abib or Nisan in any Roman month during A.D. 31 or at any time in Roman  history from 753 B.C. to 1582].  

      3.          So, we have just established from the Biblical New Testament record found in Jn 19: 14, 30-31, that Abib/Nisan 14 was the 2nd last day of the 2nd Lunar Solar weekly cycle of that 1st Biblical month, and we have established also from Jn. 19: 30-31, that the day immediately following Passover, [which we know to have been Abib/ Nisan 15, [was the 1st Holy Convocation Sabbath for the Feast of Unleavened Bread], and because that same day is also the 7th day of the 2nd Biblical Lunar Solar weekly cycle in that same month, Abib/Nisan/ 15 is automatically the 2nd Weekly Lunar Solar weekly 7th day Sabbath. This day, Abib/Nisan 15 was Christ’s “Tomb Day.” 

      Now, due to the chronic incredulity of certain SDAs and Non-SDAs who refuse to believe that Christ’s “Tomb Day,” Abib/Nisan 15 was the weekly 7th day Sabbath of that 2nd week of that 30 day month, it is also important to read the follow -ing statement by Ellen G. White found in Desire of Ages, chapter 80, entitled “In Joseph’s Tomb,” p. 676, par. 2:

      “In the beginning the Father and the Son had rested upon the Sabbath after Their work of creation. When “the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them” (Gen. 2: 1), the Creator and all heavenly beings rejoiced in contemp-lation of the glorious scene. ‘The morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.” (Job 38: 7). Now Jesus rested from His work of redemption; and though there was grief among those who loved Him on earth, yet there was joy in heaven. Glorious to the eyes of heavenly beings was the promise of the future. A restored creation, a redeemed race, that having conquered sin could never fall, - this, the result to flow from Christ’s completed work, God and angels saw. With this scene the day upon which Jesus rested is forever linked. For “His work is perfect;” and “whatsoever God doeth, it shall be forever.” (Deut. 32: 4; Eccl. 3: 14). When there shall be a “restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began,” (Acts 3: 21), the Creation Sabbath, the day on which Jesus lay at rest in Joseph’s tomb, will still be a day of rest and rejoicing. Heaven and earth will unite in praise, as “from one Sabbath to another” (Isa. 66: 23) the nations of the saved shall bow in joyful worship to God and the Lamb.”

      The totally amazing thing about this statement cited above from Desire of Ages, chapter 80, entitled “In Joseph’s Tomb,” p. 676, par. 2 [in the soft cover edition] or [pp. 769-770 in the hardcover edition of the same book], is that Ellen G. White herself had NO IDEA that the day that Christ rested in Joseph’s Tomb [which she stated unequivocally in that paragraph, was the Biblical Creation Sabbath”], was in fact the 2nd Biblical Lunar Solar weekly7th day Sabbath during the Biblical Lunar Solar month of Nisan according to the Lord’s True Lunar Solar Calendar – and NOT the 7th day “Saturday” as found in the Papal Gregorian Calendar [which was the ONLY calendar she was familiar with all of her lifetime], first as a pre-Millerite “Sunday Keeping Methodist,” and later as a “Saturday” Sabbatarian, starting in 1846 when she and her husband James White accepted the concept of “Saturday” being the 7th day Sabbath. She had NO IDEA that there was no “Friday” in the 6th day position, and no “Saturday” in the 7th day position, and no “Sunday” in the 1st day position of any of the Roman weekly cycles in the 1st Century A.D. or during Crucifixion week in 31 A.D.  

      Needless to say, as Christ’s “Tomb Day” was “Creation Sabbath,” this means that that particular day, which was Abib/Nisan 15 on the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar in A.D. 31, which occurred on the 2nd Lunar Solar weekly 7th day Sabbath in that Biblical Lunar Solar monthly cycle, clearly indicates that IN the BEGINN-ING, the 7 days of Creation Week had to have taken place “WITHIN a Biblical Lunar Solar Monthly Cycle,” something that Melody Drake and Shauna Manfredine deny to have been the case as they both insist that the Sun, Moon, and Stars were NOT CREATED until the 4th day of Creation Week. That view presents a host of different problems that will have to be the subject of another separate document. 

      Neither she nor James White, knew during their lifetime, that NO Jew  had ever kept “Saturday” as the 7th day Sabbath in the 1st Century A.D., NOR at any time during the 133 – 134 year Roman Occupation of Palestine from 63 B.C. to 70 A.D. simply because the Biblical Lunar Solar weekly Sabbath in the 1st Century A.D. NEVER EVER corresponded to a Papal alleged Roman 7th day “Saturday” position in either of the Roman Calendars during that time span, because there was NO 7th day Roman “Saturday” to keep in their day. It was  just plain and simple. The Jews COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE KEPT their weekly 7th day Sabbath on a day that Papal Rome alleges corresponded to a 7th day “Saturday” in the Roman weekly cycle in the 1st Century A.D. because “Friday” NOT “Saturday” ALWAYS
  EXISTED in the 7th day position of every Roman weekly 7 day cycle in that Century!

  Nor did she or James White or any of the other Millerites in her day appear to have known that Jesus Himself NEVER EVER kept a 7 day of the week position “Saturday” as the Sabbath, nor did His disciples, nor did any Jew of His generation nor did any Jew from the Exodus to A.D. 70. 

  ALL 21st Century SDA “Saturday” Sabbatarians, and all of the other 500+ Protestant “Saturday” Sabbatarians presumptuously take it for granted that Jesus, His disciples, and all of the Jews of His generation were observing the exact same 7th day “Saturday” as the weekly Sabbath that we find in our Papal Gregorian Calendars today, that ALL of the Protestant “Saturday” Sabbatarians are systemat-ically keeping in that same 7th day of the week position on that same Papal Calendar today! This is why they are ALL totally being LED ASTRAY on this issue, because of their inherent “religious presumptuous preconceived ideas,” on this controversial topic.

  This is a difficult concept for 21st Century 7th day Adventists who are, for the most part, systematic Papal Gregorian Calendar-oriented “Saturday” Sabbatarians and totally oblivious of the historical facts as to what actually went on during the 1st Century B.C./A.D. with regards to what type of Calendar the Jews were using during those two centuries and which day in the Roman Calendar systems, “Dies Saturnis” = Saturn’s Day or Saturday corresponded to. When this data is presented them, instead of investigating the facts for themselves, to see if what I am telling them is true or false, they systematically go into categoric catatonic spiritual/mental/ emotional  denial which doesn’t help their understanding of the truth of this issue any!

  Because of their intensive Papal Gregorian Calendar programming, and NOT realizing that the Biblical Calendar is a Lunar Solar Calendar and NOT a Roman Calendar of any type, they systematically subconsciously read the Papal Gregorian 7th day “Saturday” everywhere that the Bible uses the word “Sabbath” and then accuse people who believe in and promote the Biblical concept of Lunar Solar weekly Sabbaths of being the ones who are reading things into the texts that aren’t there, especially when the chronic, incredulous Naysayers are looking for specific catch phrases the absence of which in the text they use to hang their incredulity on! 

  They do this when explaining the Manna Miracle in Ex. 16, and when explaining the Crucifixion Week Scenario as portrayed in the N.T. Gospels. They have constructed intellectual/emotional walls or barriers in their mind against the Biblical truth that the Bible supports ONLY its own Lunar Solar Calendar and NOT a Roman Calendar of any type. Their prejudice against this subject of Lunar Solar Weekly Sabbaths makes it almost impossible for them to see and accept the truth about the Lord’s True Lunar Solar Calendar in all of its aspects, and the fact that ALL of His weekly 7th day Sabbaths are Lunar Solar Sabbaths – NOT perpetual Papal Gregorian “Saturday” Sabbaths – “Saturday” being the 7th day weekday construct that ONLY EXISTS on the Papal Gregorian Calendar launched in Oct., 1582.

  NONE of them realize that the Roman “Dies Saturnis” = Saturday NEVER DEVIATED one iota from its 1st day of the week position in the Roman weekly cycle in both of its calendar systems all throughout the 1st Centuries B.C./A.D. and NEVER DID exist in the 7th day position in any Roman calendar system during those two centuries. While this is a difficult truth for them to get their mind around, it is nevertheless the historical truth and the Biblical truth, which you will see if you let the Spirit of God open your mind enough to see it. Most people will not open their mind enough to see the truth of it because their mind is so full of prejudice, bias, and erroneous preconceived ideas that they refuse to re-examine or re-evaluate in the light of more advanced information on this topic!

  So, in fact, the historical/Archeological evidence from the 1st Century B.C./ A.D. Roman Calendar Artifacts, unequivocally CLEARLY SHOWS that Jesus NEVER ONCE in His 33 ½ years of lifetime on Planet Earth EVER KEPT a perpetual 7th day “Saturday” Sabbath!  NOT only did He never keep “a perpetual 7th day “Saturday” Sabbath” during His entire lifetime on earth, He never kept ”even ONE weekly 7th day Saturday” Sabbath let alone 52 of them per Roman yearly cycle which was systematically longer than the regular Biblical year by 4 additional weeks, -the Biblical regular year having ONLY 48 weeks. While that is “shocking news” to the ears of ALL of the members of ALL of the 500+ Protestant “Saturday” Sabbatarian communities, it is, nevertheless, the absolute historical/ Biblical truth on this subject!

  Before I go on to my next point, I want to make several other vitally import-ant quotations from the writings of Ellen G .White on this issue that will help clarify these issues in the mind of SDA Saturday Sabbatarian/Lunar Solar Feast Day keepers better, I believe, who believe in the “inspired writings” of Ellen G. White, [seeing that some SDAs appear to question my allegiance to the writings of Ellen G. White, because I take issue with her “Saturday” Sabbatarian claims – NOT because I don’t believe in her Prophetic Ministry or in her writings, but because the Biblical evidence and the historical/archeological Roman Calendar Artifact evidence combined clearly show that she did not have a correct grasp of the True Biblical 7th day Sabbath truth that she thought all during her 70 year prophetic ministry was referring to the 7th day of the week “Saturday” that she saw in the calendar weekday construct that they were all using in North American and throughout Western Europe in her day:

    The following statement from DA, Chap. 82, entitled, “Why Weepest Thou”, p. 697 [paper back edition, par. 3 [pp. 793-794 in the hardcover edition], confirms that Christ died on the 6th day of the week and that they were deprived of His body [obviously due to His resurrection] on the 1st day of the next week:

    “Trouble seemed crowing upon trouble. On the sixth day of the week they had seen their Master die; on the first day of the next week they found themselves deprived of His body, and they were accused of having stolen it away for the sake of deceiving the people. They despaired of ever correcting the false impressions that were gaining ground against them. They feared the enmity of the priests and the wrath of the people. They longed for the presence of Jesus, who had helped them in every perplexity.” DA, Chap. 82, entitled, “Why Weepest Thou”, p. 697 [paper back edition, par. 3 [pp. 793-794 in the hardcover edition].

    I have already established earlier in this document, that the Biblical Record in Jn. 19: 14, 42 and in Jn. 20: 1-2, [on which the above statement [by Ellen G. White in DA, Chap. 82, entitled, “Why Weepest Thou”, p. 697 [paper back edition, par. 3], is predicated, is clearly NOT talking about Friday, the 6th day of the Roman weekly Cycle, [which is where it occurs on our current Gregorian weekly cycles], [as “Dies Veneris,” = “Friday” was the 7th day of the Roman Weekly cycle in A.D. 31, NOT the 6th day of their week; nor when the Biblical record in Jn. 20: 1-2 speaks about Christ’s Resurrection is it talking about “Sunday,” the alleged 1st day of the next Roman weekly cycle, as “Sunday” was always the 2nd day of the Roman weekly cycle in A.D. 31, and NOT in the 1st day of the weekly cycle in the Gregorian Calendar where it has always been ONLY SINCE Oct., 1582. 

    Ellen G. White DID NOT understand the statements that she wrote in DA, Chap. 82, entitled, “Why Weepest Thou”, p. 697, as occurring “from a Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar perspective,” however. She always saw them “from the perspective of the calendar that they were all using in her day” that did not exist in Christ’s day! This is why in some of her writings, she speaks of Christ being crucified on a Friday, in the tomb on a “Saturday” and arose on a “Sunday.” This is why she speaks in her writings concerning the Manna Story in Ex. 16 about the Hebrews collecting a double amount of Manna on “Friday,” which is what she honestly thought “Preparation Day” was referring to, for next day, which was “the Biblical 7th day Sabbath,” which she thought, because of the many years of erroneous Papal Programming about the Sabbath/Sunday issue was referring to “Saturday.” She is NOT a False Prophetess because she did not understand this fact correctly. She just simply did not understand the Biblical weekly cycle because she knew nothing about the True Lunar Solar weekly cycles contained in the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar. All that she knew about was the 7 day weekly cycle that she was using in her day the same as everyone else, and in that 7 day weekly cycle, which she mistook for the Biblical Calendar weekly cycle from Creation Week she saw “Friday” in the 6th day position of the week, “Saturday” in the 7th day position of the week, and “Sunday” in the 1st day position of the week. ALL Christians have received that same Papal Gregorian weekday outlay programming for the past 391 years in North America since 1620. ALL Churches in the 21st Century are systemat-ically teaching it including all of the Sunday keeping Churches and all of the Saturday Sabbatarian Churches! The whole Christian World is drunk with the wine of Spiritual Babylon on these vitally important Calendation Issues.

    She thought that the Biblical text in the Gospels was talking about a “Friday,” the 6th day [in our Papal Gregorian weekly cycle], and that the 1st day of the week in the Biblical context was referring to Sunday, [the 1st day of the week in the Papal Gregorian weekly cycle] which weekly cycle they were all familiar with in her day, NOT realizing that the Papal Gregorian weekly cycle NO LONGER reflected the true Roman 7 day weekly cycle as it existed during Crucifixion Week in A.D. 31. 

    Neither does Melody Drake, nor Shauna Manfredine, nor Elder John Vandenburg, Lynnford Beachy, Bob Trefz,  and a whole host of SDAs who still promote the False Papal Friday, Saturday, Sunday Crucifixion to Resurrection day scenario, totally oblivious that NO Roman calendar in the 1st Century B.C. or A.D. will support that False Papal Friday, Saturday, Sunday Crucifixion to Resurrection day scenario. Those events clearly, historically, DID NOT HAPPEN on the week-days that Papal Rome says they occurred on, which Friday, Saturday, Sunday Roman calendar weekday sequence NEVER EXISTED in any Roman Calendar Construct until Oct., 1582.

    In the following statements by Ellen G. White in G.C., p. 399, pars. 3-4, Ellen G. White indicates that how the Jews practiced their one day Feast of Passover and the 1st two days of their 7 day Feast of Unleavened Bread in A.D. 31, was the same way it was celebrated 1500 years previously at the time of the Exodus, the Passover being celebrated on the 14th day of the 1st month, and Wave Sheaf Day, 3 days later [reckoned inclusively]:

    “The slaying of the Passover lamb was a shadow of the death of Christ. Says Paul, ‘Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us.’ [I Cor. 5: 7]. The sheaf of first-fruits, which at the time of the Passover was waved before the Lord, was typical of the resurrection of Christ. Paul says, in speaking of the resurrection, ‘Christ the first-fruits; afterward they are Christ’s at His coming.’ [I Cor. 15: 23, 20]. Like the wave-sheaf, which was the first ripe grain gathered before the harvest, Christ is the first-fruits of that immortal harvest of redeemed ones that at the future resurrection shall be gathered into the garner of God.

    “These types were fulfilled, not only as to the event, but as to the time. On the fourteenth day of the first Jewish month, the very day and month on which, for fifteen long centuries, the Passover had been slain, Christ, having eaten the Passover with His disciples, instituted that feast that was to commemorate His own death as ‘the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.’ That same night He was taken by wicked hands, to be crucified and slain. And as the antitype of the wave-sheaf, our Lord was raised from the dead on the third day, ‘the first-fruits of them that slept,’ [Phil. 3: 21] a sample of all the resurrected just, whose ‘vile body’ shall be changed, and ‘fashioned like unto His glorious body.’” [Phil. 3: 21].

    I have already shown, thus far, in this study that Jn. 19: 14, 30-31 clearly shows that the Jews were keeping all of their Holy Days [including their weekly 7th day Sabbaths as well as their Yearly Festivals] according to the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar which means, that what Ellen G. White says about those Jewish practices during Crucifixion Week, [except for the Crucifixion process itself and the goings on related to it], was how they were practiced during the month of Abib at the time of the Exodus in the mid-15th Century B.C., which clearly indicates that Abib 15 back then”was also the 2nd weekly Lunar Solar Sabbath” for the month of Abib back at the time of the Exodus which ALL Anti-Lunar Solar weekly Sabbath Naysayers deny to be true.

    ALL 7th  day Sabbatarians also know, that there are ONLY 4 weekly Biblical 7th day Sabbaths in any given Biblical month. But as people like Melody Drake, Shauna Manfredine, Elder John Vandenburg and a whole host of other well-meaning SDAs who believe in the Lunar Solar Calendar, [arbitrarily categorically refuse to believe that the 4 weekly Biblical Lunar Solar 7th day Sabbaths fall on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days of each Biblical Lunar Solar month], is because they all want to believe that they occur ONLY on the Papal Antichrist’s Counterfeit Gregorian Calendar which Satan had the Papal System devise to make people believe that they must look to the calendar that he devised and had Papal Rome generate in Oct., 1582 to totally confuse God’s professed people from knowing where the Lord’s True weekly 7th day Sabbaths are to be found and on what days of the month they are to occur, etc.

    The old devil has done a marvelous work of deception. He has invented all sorts of Pagan/Heathen World Religions: Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, Jainism, Daoism, Shintoism and a whole host of others including False Twisted Talmudic Zionist Khazarian Judaism, etc.

    He has approximately 2 billion Muslims believing that ALLAH is the God of the Universe when ALLAH is another name for the ancient Mesopotamian Moon god “Sin.” He also has them keeping a perpetual “Friday” based on the 6th day of the week in the Counterfeit Papal Gregorian Calendar that he had the Papacy set up in Oct., 1582 to lead as many people away from the Lord’s True Lunar Solar Calendar.

    He [Satan] has approximately 1 billion Catholics//Orthodox and approximate ly 1 billion Protestants keeping the 1st day of the week on that same Counterfeit Papal Gregorian Calendar.

    He has ALL of the 7th day Sabbatarian Church, keeping the 7th day of the Counterfeit Papal Gregorian Calendar - its 7th day “Saturday” every week as if it were the Lord’s True Biblical Sabbath when it is nothing of the kind 99% of the year, being ONLY the True Biblical Sabbath 4 to 8 days per year depending on whether it is a regular Biblical Lunar Solar Year or a Biblical Lunar Solar Leap Year. 

    He [Satan] has, what professes itself to be the “Remnant Church” [i.e., the SDA Church System, which boasts of a worldwide membership of 25+ million people also keeping the False perpetual “Saturday” Sabbath on his [Satan’s] Gregorian Calendar as the Biblical 7th day Sabbath all 52 weeks per year, even though the Lord’s True Lunar Solar Calendar ONLY has 48 weeks in it, most years, having 52 weeks in it ONLY ONCE every 3rd year, and the few people who CLAIM to believe in the Lord’s True Lunar Solar Calendar he has constantly fighting over how the Biblical “New Moon Day” is to be Located, or fighting amongst themselves as to whether or not ALL of the Lord’s Holy Days/Worship Days/Set Apart Days that are listed in His Worship Manual found in Lev. 23 are to be kept completely, or ONLY PARTIALLY, on His True Lunar Solar Calendar, or whether or not one of those Holy/Worship Days – i.e., His weekly one – His 7th day Sabbath is to be kept on the Lord’s  ONLY True Calendar – [i.e., His Celestial Lunar Solar Calendar] that is out of the reach of man who cannot tamper with it physically, [though he is indeed tampering with it mentally and spiritually], choosing to ONLY keep PART of the Lord’s True worship days, that is, ONLY His Yearly ones – [His Yearly Feasts with their accompanying collective 7 Yearly Holy Convocation Sabbaths] ACCORDING TO the Lord’s True Lunar Solar Calendar, while systematically choosing to keep His weekly 7th day Sabbath,  NOT according to His True Lunar Solar Calendar - [which is obviously WHERE they should be being kept], - if His Professed People who claim to be following His True Lunar Solar Calendar were not acting in open rebellion against His Calendar by keeping His True weekly 7th day Sabbath on the calendar that Satan caused Papal Rome to generate in Oct., 1582. 

    It is totally amazing to see even our own SDA Church System totally setting itself in Battle Array against the Lord’s True Calendar – claiming that ALL of the Lord’s Yearly Festivals with their collective 7 yearly Holy Convocation Sabbaths were ALL ABOLISHED by Christ when He died on the Cross – a False doctrine inherited by the Protestant Churches from the Catechism of the Catholic Counter-Reformation Council of Trent. If you don’t believe that, Google the Catechism of the Council of Trent and give it a read!

    It is also amazing to see so many well-meaning people within the Lunar Sslar Camp [who CLAIM to be believers in and to be observers of the Lord’s True Celestial Lunar Solar Calendar], also setting themselves in Chronic Battle Array against the keeping of the Lord’s True weekly 7th day Sabbath according to His Lunar Solar Calendar System, because they have purposely chosen to ignore His Calendar when it comes to His True 7th day Sabbath, and have chosen to keep it “according to the day that it perpetually exists in the 7th day position of Satan’s Papal Gregorian Counterfeit Calendar” ALL 52 days per year when it CANNOT POSSIBLY be His True Sabbath most of the time because it is being systematically kept every single week on Satan’s Papal Jesuit-produced Counterfeit Calendar simply because of its 7th day position “Saturday”, – and he has led the majority of these good people who truly desire to follow the Lord, to invent myriad excuses as to why the Lord’s True weekly 7th day Sabbath CANNOT BE KEPT on His ONLY True Calendar – His Lunar Solar Calendar, but MUST BE KEPT according to the Papal Gregorian Calendar’s new “Sunday to Saturday” weekly cycle – a Roman weekly cycle never before seen in Roman history between the years 45 B.C. to Oct. 4, 1582!

    Then there is the case of the New World Calendar, that some twisted souls hope to introduce next December, 2012. This New Calendar will simply rearrange the days of the Counterfeit Papal Gregorian Calendar one step further, turning the current Counterfeit Papal “Sunday to Saturday” weekly cycle [that DID NOT EXIST in Christ’s day in the 1st Century A.D.], into a New “Monday to Sunday” revised Gregorian Calendar weekly cycle. This will be totally different than any calendar ever produced since 45 B.C., in that it will have eleven 30 days months and one 35 day month, plus it will  have several “World Days” that, though they will appear on that calendar, will not be included into the monthly count of the days! This will definitely stir the Calendation pot and bring the controversy to new  heights. This will make the keeping of “Saturday” even more problematic for those who are perpetual diehard, hardliner, “Saturday” Sabbatarians.

    It will dramatically affect the weekly worship day of all of the Biblical related religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. They just aren’t aware of it yet! 

    ALL of the Sunday keepers will find their weekly worship day switched from its 1st day of the Current Counterfeit Gregorian weekly cycle to the 7th day of that weekly cycle. It will switch the “Saturday” Sabbatarian weekly worship day from its current 7th day position [which is already incorrect because it does not line up with the Creator’s weekly 7th day Sabbath timeslots of the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days of the Biblical Lunar Solar monthly cycle most of the year, to a NEW 6th day of the week position on the New World Calendar putting it where the Papal Gregorian Friday now exists, and it will put the 1-2 Billion Muslims in a tizzy, because their present Papal Gregorian 6th day of the week “Friday,” will be moved back one timeslot to the 5th day position, which Thursday now currently occupies.

    As you can imagine, total religious chaos will break out on this Weekly Worship Day issue. The Germans have already been keeping this “Monday to Sunday” style calendar for several years already. It hasn’t come to North America as yet. It is supposed to come on stream in North America in December of 2012.

    It will be interesting to watch what all of the Papal Gregorian Calendar-oriented “Saturday” Sabbatarian Church groups will do concerning this issue of what they currently falsely believe to be the Lord’s True Biblical 7th day Sabbath which they currently keep religiously all 52 weeks where the Papal Gregorian 7th day of the week “Saturday” now appears, when they see “Saturday” MOVE to the 6th day position of the New World Calendar’s weekly cycle. 

    The question is, will they comply with the new Calendar weekday sequence, which will place what they currently assume to be the True 7th day of the Week Biblical 7th day Sabbath in a totally new position or weekly timeslot which will be NO LONGER located in that same 7th day of the Week timeslot on the Papal Gregorian Calendar that they all currently  use, [that they have already been erroneously keeping in the 7th day position for more than 100 years – 167 years for SDAs]? 

    What will they do? And what will you do? And what will Elder John Vandenburg, Sandy Clark, Melody Drake, Shuana Manfredine, Bob Trefz, Jan Marcussen, Ron du Preez, Carl Baxter, Brian Hoeck, Lew White, Tim McHyde and all of the other chronic SDA Lunar Solar Calendar Anti-Lunar Solar weekly Sabbath NAYSAYERS do when this  happens, including our whole alleged 25+ million SDA membership worldwide when the change comes? I can’t wait for it to happen so that I can sit back and watch to see what they are all going to do on this issue then!

    Some relatives of mine who are SDAs and ardent defenders of the Papal 7th day of the week “Saturday” as the True Biblical 7th day Sabbath of the 4th Commandment have told me: “I KNOW that the Sabbath is “Saturday” and no matter what they do to the calendar, and where they place “Saturday” on it, I will continue to keep “Saturday” as the Sabbath in the new calendar weekly cycle. They claim to “KNOW” with absolute certainty that the Gregorian “Saturday” is the True Biblical Creation Sabbath! Do they now? What causes them to KNOW or CLAIM to KNOW that the Papal Gregorian Calendar “Saturday” that they have been observing and believing in for the past 167 years is the True Biblical 7th day Sabbath when our SDA Church system was having misgivings about it according to a statement in their Lunation Chart for 1883? Here is that statement:

    "Those who disbelieve in the seventh-day Sabbath bring against it numerous objections, all of which are readily answer -ed with the exception of one, – THE CROSS.  This is the great, the  unanswerable objection to the Bible Sabbath."  
    Furthermore, Below is the Lunation Chart for July 1883 on page 66 of  the online 2007 SDA Year-book. It is taken from the article by my much esteemed SDA Sister Kerrie French entitled: TheOneUnanswerable Objection_ 12Criteria, p. 10. I have magnified the chart so that one can read it better. 


    Where do 21st Century perpetual “Saturday” Sabbatarians among the 500+ Protestant 7th day Sabbatarian Churches find in the Bible that “Saturday” is the 7th day Sabbath? It exists NOWHERE in the Bible from Gen. 1: 1 to Rev. 22: 21. The ONLY place they can get it from, is from the Papal Gregorian Calendar that is only 429 years old, not having been conceived and brought forth by the Papal System, [Satan’s Masterpiece of Spiritual Deception], until Oct., 1582. 

    So, obviously, as the Gregorian Calendar is ONLY 429 years old, it clearly DID NOT EXIST in the 1st Century A.D. when Christ, the Creator of the Universe and of the weekly 7th day  Sabbath lived on Planet Earth; and as the Roman Calendar artifacts from both the 1st Century B.C./A.D. clearly indicate that the Roman Calendars back then, had a perpetual “Saturday to Friday” weekday sequence, NOT a Papal Gregorian “Sunday to Saturday” weekday sequence. That has very serious implications as you can imagine!

    Hence, it logically follows, that as the Papal Gregorian “Sunday to Saturday” weekday sequence DID NOT EXIST when Christ was on the earth, that [whatever way He was keeping the Biblical 7th day Sabbath that He Himself had generated, and on whatever Calendar Construct He was keeping it according to], it clearly WOUND NOT HAVE and COULD NOT HAVE possibly coincided with a NON-EXISTENT Roman 1st Century alleged “Saturday” that ONLY exists in the late 16th Century Papal Gregorian Calendar of Oct., 1582, which neither goes back to the 1st Century A.D., nor to the initiation of the Roman Julian Calendar in 46-45 B.C., NOR does it go back to the time of Moses, the Hebrews, and the Exodus, and MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, - NEITHER does it go back to Creation Week. 

    So, you should be clearly able to connect the dots and see that  this totally absurd concept of “Saturday” [which all of the members of the “Saturday” Sabbat-arian Churches get themselves worked up into a frenzy emotionally and mentally over], as being “Creation Week Sabbath,” which they presumptuously assume was  produced by Christ the Creator of the weekly 7th day Sabbath from Creation week, is the most absurd, asinine “self-deceptive” concept that Lucifer, the fallen angel, [who is deadly opposed to the Lord’s True Sabbath because it is the sign of His Creative Power and Creative Activities during Creation Week, as well as the sign that He is the One True God that Sanctifies His People, etc.], that he has ever foisted upon humanity in these last days of earth’s history and yet, ALL of the Saturday Sabbatarian Protestant Churches including 99.99% of the 21st Century SDA Church System and its membership, gladly, yet blindly except this Satanic false doctrine as ABSOLUTE TRUTH on this Sabbath to Sunday issue and then have to audacity to turn around and tell those who keep His weekly 7th day Sabbath accord-ing to His divinely established Lunar Solar Calendar System, are the deceived, deluded ones because they are not following the same Papal Gregorian “Saturday” for the Biblical weekly Sabbath that they have systematically chosen to follow all 52 weeks that it appears in the Antichrist System’s Gregorian Calendar! Who is the real deceived person here, the individual who keeps the Lord’s True Weekly 7th day Sabbath on His ONE and ONLY True Calendar – His Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar, based on “His Divinely established Worship Directives” found in His Worship Manual located in Lev. 23, or those who systematically attempt to keep the 7th day of Papal Rome’s Gregorian Jesuit-produced Calendar that Satan is the initiator of? 

    In order for the Papal Gregorian 7th day of the week “Saturday,” to be Christ’s TRUE BIBLCAL 7th day weekly Sabbath ALL 52 weeks that it appears on the Calendar that Satan directed the Papal System to generate in Oct., 1582, we would have to affirm that the Papal Gregorian Calendar is the True Biblical Calendar and that it was produced NOT at the instigation of Satan, but at the instigation of Christ Himself. Is Christ Jesus the Divine Author of the Papal Gregorian Calendar of Oct., 1582, - the very power that prophecy in Dan. 7: 25 indicates would CHANGE the timing of His Worship Days that we know are all listed in Lev. 23? That is the question you need to settle in your mind, as every man, woman and child will have to settle it in their own mind in the not too distant future.

    The problem is, that as the Protestant “Saturday” Sabbatarians have bought into this Satanic delusion of the Gregorian Calendar “Saturday” being the True Bible Sabbath, they refuse to completely study this issue from all angles to ascertain what the REAL TRUTH on this issue really is. 

    I have other SDAs who have told me that if they could only go to Church 4-8 times per year, they think that they would give up going to Church altogether. What kind of senseless alleged “presumptuous” faith is that? Why do they bother going to Church at all if simply being able to associate and socialize with their friends and relatives and other church members appears to be their main motivation for being there? 

    We are supposed to Go to Church to Worship God according to the Days that He has prescribed in Scripture, NOT on days that are not on His Biblical Calendar that is presented in Lev. 23. So what is one to do when only 4-8 Gregorian “Saturdays” actually line up with the Biblical Calendar’s weekly 7th day Worship time slots? Are we to consistently go to what every 7th day Sabbatarian Church we belong to on every single “Saturday,” when we KNOW that those days DO NOT line up with His preset weekly worship dates most of the year? 

    This is a dilemma for the “emotionally-driven, socializing 7th day Sabbatarians” and for other 7th day Sabbatarian of what ever of the 500+ Protestant 7th day Sabbatarian denomination we belong to. 

    Many people go to Church simply out of “Habit,” or because they feel it is a duty that is required of them that they must fulfill. But is going through the “forms of religion,” worshiping on days that actually DO NOT OCCUR on the Lord’s True weekly Worship Schedule really constitute obedience to His revealed will in the Scriptures as delineated in Lev. 23? Of course not; especially when they are keeping days that belong purely to a Pagan Calendar that Satan had Papal Rome set up in Oct., 1582 to confuse God’s people as to when His true weekly 7th day Sabbath was to occur, depriving them of the knowledge of His True Lunar Solar Calendar System in which His true weekly worship day can ONLY PERIODICALLY fall on a Gregorian “Saturday” in that Papal Jesuit-produced Calendar.

    There are several reasons why people who have been “Saturday” Sabbatar-ians for many years, including even those who have accepted in principle that His Lunar Solar Calendar is True so that they can keep all of His Yearly Festivals/ Yearly Holy Convocation Sabbaths on it, who nevertheless inconsistently CATEGORICALLY REFUSE to keep His weekly 7th day Sabbath on that same True Biblical Calendar. Here are some of those possible reasons:

    1.    Financial self-interest. There are millions of people in the work force that is totally controlled by the Papal Gregorian weekly cycle and naturally, they don’t want to lose their job, because they wouldn’t be able to pay their mortgage, generate future Pension Benefits, be able to educate their kids, have a roof over their head and food on their table, etc. 

    This is a very legitimate realistic concern and a very real issue that everyone in the workforce has to realistically contend with if they adopt the True Biblical 7th day Sabbath based on and to be kept ONLY by the Lord’s True Lunar Solar Calendar on the timeslots that He, NOT Papal Rome has set up, or that the various Protestant “Saturday” Churches have set up! 

    It cannot be realistically kept otherwise and be truly serving the Lord or be truly conforming to His revealed will in this area. There can be NO COMPROMISE in this area of faith and practice, and so here is where the sifting POLARIZATION will take place more than in any other area of their religious life in this 21st Century. 

    Every man, woman, and child will eventually be TOTALLY POLARIZED on these issues connected to TRUE WORSHIP and the timing of that worship set out in the Lord’s Worship Manual located in Lev. 23. Which CALENDAR one uses to KEEP those various Worship Days as listed in that chapter on, is of CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE to God, even though it may seem trivial to humans in the 21st Century, because which CALENDAR you choose to keep ALL of them by, [NOT just SOME of them], determines whether you are truly on the Lord’s side, fully in His Camp or partially in the enemy’s camp.

    But most “Saturday” Sabbatarians who ignorantly attempt to keep His weekly Sabbath on the Wrong Calendar timeslots most of the year, and who at the same time totally ignore and never keep the rest of His Worship days as if they NEVER EXISTED to begin with, are no better than the Hybrid Calendar keepers who make no distinction between the Sacred and the Profane when dealing with the Lord’s Holy days in the 21st Century just as He accused the Religious Leaders of His people in Ancient Israel as mentioned in Ez. 22: 26 of doing. They ONLY keep His Yearly Festivals with their accompanying Holy Convocation Sabbaths that ONLY occur during 3 of the 12-13 Biblical months per year, while purposely choosing to keep His weekly Worship day on a Calendar System devised by Satan and orchestrated via the Papal System in 1582. Is that not mixing the Sacred and the Profane in Calendation issues, when you try to keep one of the Lord’s Worship days on a Calendar system of purely pagan origin while keeping the rest of them on His True Lunar Solar Calendar?

    2.    The second reason has to do with Fellowshipping with fellow believers. If people accept the True Lunar Solar Calendar 7th day Sabbath and begin to practice it on His true Lunar Solar weekly time slots of the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days of His Calendar monthly cycles, [which is what they should be doing], these Biblical Lunar Solar Dates WILL NOT CONSISTENTLY FALL every week on a Papal Gregorian “Saturday” – the ONLY Roman Calendar system ever to have “Saturday” in the 7th day position of its weekly cycle throughout Roman history from 45 B.C. to the launching of the Gregorian Calendar in Oct., 1582. They will find that it will ONLY coincide with a “Saturday” in the Papal Gregorian Calendar 4 weeks out of the Gregorian yearly cycle when the Gregorian year corresponds to a Regular Biblical year of 12 months and 48 week; or 8 days per year, when the Gregorian Calendar corresponds only partially to a Biblical Leap year, because both calendar systems will have a total of 52 weeks in them at that time.

    And even then, because of the way the True Biblical Calendar works, the 4 weekly Biblical Lunar Solar Sabbaths will NOT, in most cases all FALL in the same Gregorian monthly cycle, but in some Gregorian months, will straddle two Gregorian months: the last 3 weeks in one Gregorian month and the 1st week in the following Gregorian month.

    For example:

    In January, Biblical New Moon fell on Thursday, Jan. 6. Hence, the True Biblical weekly 7th day Sabbath occurred on Thursday, Jan. 13, 20, 27 and on Thursday, Feb. 3.

    In February, Biblical New Moon Day Thursday, Feb.  3 and the 4 weekly Sabbaths occurred on Thursday,  Feb. 10, 17, 24, and Thursday, March 3.

    In March, Biblical New Moon Day - Sunday, March 6 and the 4 Biblical weekly 7th day Sabbaths should have been listed as occurring on Sunday 13, 20, 27 and Sunday April 3.

    In April, Biblical New Moon Day – Tuesday, April 5 and the 4 Biblical weekly 7th day Sabbaths took place on Tuesday, April 12, 19, 26, and Tuesday, May 3.

    In May,  Biblical New Moon Day – Thursday, May 5, and the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths should have been listed as occurring on Thursday, May 12, 19, 26, and Thursday, June 2.

    In June, Biblical New Moon Day – Friday, June 3, and the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths will occur on Friday, June 10, 17, 24, and Friday, July 1.

    July,  Biblical New Moon Day – Sunday July 3 and the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths will occur on Sunday, July 10, 17, 24, 31.

    August, Biblical New Moon Day – Monday, Aug. 1 and the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths will occur on Monday, August, 8, 15, 22, 29. 

    September, Biblical New Moon Day – for September is will take place on Wednesday, August 31, and the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths will take place on  Wednesday,  Sept. 7, 14, 21, 28.

    October, Biblical New Moon Day for October actually will occur on Thursday, Sept. 29 and the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths will occur on Thursday, Oct. 6, 13, 20, 27.

    November - Biblical New Moon Day – will take place on Friday, Oct. 28. The 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths therefore will take place on Friday, Nov. 4, 11, 18, 25.

    December - Biblical New Moon Day for the month of December will take place on Sunday, Nov. 27. Therefore, the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths will occur on Sunday, Dec. 4, 11, 18, 25.

    What can we learn about where,  on a Papal Gregorian Calendar, the 4 Biblical Lunar Solar weekly 7th day Sabbaths are to occur when the Gregorian Calendar dates are synchronized with the correct days and dates on the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar, not the reverse: 

    A.  In January [31 day month], February [28 day month] , March [31 day month], April [30 day month], May [31 day month], June [30 day month] – All of those 1st 6 months of the Gregorian Calendar, from January to June, the Biblical Lunar Solar 4 week Sabbaths will occur exactly one week subsequent to Biblical New Moon Day during the last 3 weeks in the 1st month and in the 1st week of the next Gregorian month that follows it.

    B.  In July [31 day month], August [31 day month], September [30 day month],   October [31 day month] , November [30 day month],  and December [31 day month] – ALL of the last 6 months of the Gregorian yearly cycle from July to December, the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths will ALL fall in the same monthly cycle beginning exactly one week AFTER the Biblical New Moon Day on each of those Papal Gregorian Calendar monthly cycles. This is how the true Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar works!

    When there are 8 Gregorian “Saturdays” that correspond to the 4 Biblical Lunar Solar weekly time slots of the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days of the Biblical Lunar Solar month, they will occur NOT in a continuous series of 8 weeks, but in two separate blocks of 4 weeks each, one block of 4 weeks in the spring and one block of 4 weeks in the fall of the year. The spring block of 4 weeks will stradde two Papal Gregorian months depending in which Gregorian months they begin in, whereas wherever they occur in the fall of the year, all  4 Biblical Lunar Solar weekly cycles will fall in the same Gregorian monthly cycle.

    That Christ, His Apostles, and ALL of the Jews worldwide, in the 1st Century A.D. were ALL systematically keeping the 4 Biblical Lunar Solar Weekly Sabbaths per Biblical Lunar Solar month on the Biblical timeslots of the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days of their Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar month is obvious from the Biblical evidence found in Jn. 19: 14, 30-31.  

    None of us can afford to rise up in opposition to new light on this subject and refuse to examine all of the details of that new light due to personal prejudice and bias created by our own presuppositions about any subject, and this is one of the most controversial topics within the 7th day Sabbatarian communities today.  People get all “emotionally wired for sound” when you question what they are presently believing about the 7th day Sabbath and what they are currently using for evidence to support their belief in a perpetual endless cycle of weekly “Saturday” Sabbaths that can be proven to be a NON-BIBLICAL, totally unprovable presupposition that they are presently believing to be absolute unassailable truth! 

    What this says to me is that most people are really “NOT HONESTLY INTEREST-ED” in knowing ”what the Biblical Truth of this issue really is” once you question what they believe on this touchy subject. In some cases, they are simply motivated by fear of losing their faith in something that they have been believing for many years even though their present belief in a perpetual “Saturday” Sabbath is based primarily on the 7th day position of that day in the weekly cycle of the Counterfeit Gregorian Calendar that Christ, the Creator of the weekly 7th day Sabbath NEVER PRODUCED!  For other people they are most likely blinded by their own personal self-interest [whether financial, social, emotional, etc.], and are desperately looking for “LOOPHOLES” just as all of the Naysayers are who categorically refuse to believe the Biblical truth on this issue which is clearly seen from Jn. 19: 14, 30-31 as well as from Ex. 16.

    One such twisted soul is Melody Drake. Another is Shauna Manfredine who goes out of her way to deny that the 15th day of the Biblical month of Abib can ever be a weekly 7th day Lunar Solar Sabbath. Both she and Melody Drake also try to side step or stick handle around the evidence in Ex. 16 that contains the Manna Miracle and that clearly shows that the Lord’s Calendar is a Lunar Solar Calendar, saying that there is no way to know whether or not the Lord spoke to the complain-ing Hebrews on the 15th of Iyar [Zif], or that He caused the Manna to descend on the earth for them at sunrise the very next day, that is on the 16th day of the 29 day month of Iyar, They obviously haven’t thoroughly thought their position through!

    They both take their negative, incredulous, position that they presently maintain, simply because God didn’t spell it out for them in black and white in the text by naming the exact date of the month that the Manna Miracle began on. There is a lot of speculation about what the Bible is or is not saying by these SDA sisters when they don’t find something spelled out for them explicitly in the Biblical text. 

    They both look for loopholes to hand their incredulity on. God doesn’t always spell out everything. He expects us to use the analytical reasoning ability that He gave us to figure certain things out for ourselves. While, on the one hand they often quibble over insignificant trivialities, they both have no problem in “allegedly keeping” what they “assume to be” the Lord’s True Sabbath, NOT on the Calendar Construct that He produced, but on the Jesuit-produced Papal Gregorian Calendar that Satan caused Papal Rome to orchestrate in Oct., 1582, by switching the days of the Roman weekly cycle around from its former “Saturday to Friday” sequence to a NEW INNOVATIVE “Sunday to Saturday” sequence to fit its False Propaganda Statements relative to the Lord’s Most Important Worship Day – His Biblical 7th day Sabbath.

    As Iyar or Zif, the 2nd Biblical month is a 29 day month, and the Biblical record explicitly states in Ex. 16: 1 that the Hebrews arrived at the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the 15th day of the 2nd month [after their departing out of the land of Egypt], that just leaves us a total of 14 days in that 2nd Biblical month, as 29 days minus 15 days = 14 days, which is exactly two complete 7 day weekly cycles from the 15th of Iyar/Zif to the end of that same 29 day month. There is NO WIGGLE ROOM there to play with. Everyone who is a Naysayer on the subject of weekly Lunar Solar Sabbaths contest the contents of Ex. 16, and the reason they do, is that they are all overlooking the fact that there are only 14 days left in that 2nd Biblical month AFTER the 15th day which is indeed expressly mentioned!

    It makes no sense for either of them to state that because the Bible does not state which day the falling of the manna took place on, it could have been any day, the 16th, the 17th or some other day! That won’t do, because the manna story in the Biblical text AFTER the murmuring incident on the 15th day ONLY leaves two possible 7 day weekly cycles left during which there were two periods of 6 days of gathering, that were each followed immediately by a weekly 7th day Sabbath, seeing that that month is a 29 say month.

    If you look at Ex. 16: 2-13, the immediate context indicates that God reacted immediately to the murmuring of the Hebrews by promising them quails in the evening [obviously that same evening of the 15th of Iyar] and manna in the morning [obviously in the morning at sunrise] on the 16th of Iyar/Zif. 
    It goes on to say in v. 5, that the manna gathering was to take place on 6 consecutive days beginning on the next morning [which obviously had to have been the 16th of Iyar/Zif], and v. 6 also states that they would gather twice as much on the 6th day, and that they were to prepare that which they took in as a double amount on the 6th day of the gathering process, in preparation for the 7th day Sabbath, which was the very next day on which NO Manna would be given!

    Furthermore, Ex. 16: 16-26 explicitly mentions the preparation of the double portion collected on the 6th day, in preparation for the following day which was the 7th day Sabbath, mentioned in v. 26. 

    In v. 27, the Biblical record indicates that some disobedient Hebrews went out to gather Manna on the 7th day which was the Sabbath, but found none. Verses 29-30 refers to that same 7th day as the Sabbath. 

    Hence, Iyar/Zif 16 to Iyar/Zif 21 would be the 1st  6 days of gathering of Manna after the 15th day of Iyar/Zif.  That would make the 7th day Sabbath following Iyar/Zif 15, [the day that they arrived at the Wilderness of Sin], occur on the 7th day from Iyar 15, which would be Iyar/Zif 22. 

    Now we still have one more 7 day weekly cycle in that month in that month to deal with. 

    Hence, the manna gathering began again on the 1st day of the 4th weekly cycle for the month of Iyar/Zif, which 1st day of that 4th week would have been Iyar/Zif 23. 

    So they would gather manna for another 6 days inclusively from Iyar/Zif 23 to Iyar/Zif 28, and on that day, Iyar/Zif 28, they would gather again a double portion and prepare it for the 7th day Sabbath which would take place the next day, which would be Iyar/Zif 29, which would have been the last 7th day Sabbath for the 29 day month of Iyar/Zif. 

    From this internal context of the Biblical content of Ex. 16, we now have fixed the dates of two Biblical weekly 7th day Sabbaths that followed Iyar/Zif 15 [the day that the Hebrews arrived at the Wilderness of Sin]. Those two weekly Sabbaths occurred on the 22nd and the 29th days respectively of that same 2nd Biblical month of Iyar/Zif. 

    As there are ONLY 4 complete 7 day weekly cycles in any given Biblical month, the 7th day of each of those Biblical weekly 7 day cycles being a Biblical weekly 7th day Sabbath, we have now located two of the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths for the 29 day month of Iyar/Zif as having occurred on Iyar/Zif 22 and Iyar/Zif 29, and we only have 14 days to work backward in time with from the 2nd last weekly 7th day Sabbath in that same month, which clearly occurred on Iyar/Zif 22.

    Therefore, Iyar/Zif 22 minus 7 days, brings us back to Iyar/Zif 15 which was the day that the Hebrews arrived at the wilderness of Sin, which means that that date was the 2nd weekly 7th day Sabbath for that same 29 day month. 

    If we backtrack another 7 days from Iyar/Zif 15, we arrive at Iyar/Zif 8, which was the 1st weekly 7th day Sabbath for that 29 day 2nd Biblical month of Iyar/Zif. 

    Thus we have now established that the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths for the 29 day 2nd Biblical month of Iyar/Zif occurred on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days of that month. The 1st weekly 7th day Sabbath occurs exactly 7 days from the  New Moon Day which is ALWAYS the 1st day of every Biblical Lunar Solar month, thus establishing the Biblical fact that the 2nd month of Iyar/Zif was clearly a 29 day Lunar Solar Calendar month! 

    New Moon Day is NEVER calculated into the 1st 7 day weekly cycle of any Biblical month as an integral part of that 1st week. Otherwise we would have every 1st week in the Biblical Lunar Solar weekly cycle being an 8 day weekly cycle, followed by 3 complete 7 day weekly Cycles. However, there is no record in the Word of God of there ever being such a thing as an 8 day weekly cycle from Creation Week to the month of Abib at the time of the Exodus, nor from the month of Abib at the time of the Exodus to the 1st Century A.D.

    Shauna Manfredine maintains that the 15th day of Abib and the 15th day of Tishri, CANNOT possibly BE a Biblical Lunar Solar weekly 7th day Sabbath because a Holy Convocation Sabbath falls on that day in both months. So, she scours around the Torah to find a Statute that states that NO fire is to be kindled on the Sabbath, [Ex. 35: 2-3], and another one that states that the people are permitted to prepare food on Holy Convocation Sabbaths. [Ex. 12: 16]. 

    She therefore tries to make the two different statutes cancel each other out in order to try to prove that the 15th day of Abib, and that the 15th day of Tishri /Ethanim can NEVER be a weekly 7th day Sabbath if a yearly Holy Convocation Sabbath ever falls on it, an event that ONLY occurs twice in each Biblical year – once on Abib/Nisan 15 and once on Tishri 15. 

    This is why I refer to both Shanna Manfredine and Melody Drake “Twisted souls” by which term I mean that that “Try to Twist Scripture” to make themselves and other people think that it really doesn’t say what it is saying on this issue because they both have “ISSUES” with the concept of Lunar Solar Weekly Sabbaths because they want to make themselves and others believe that the weekly 7th day Sabbath from Creation Week which was later written into the 4th Command –ment,  somehow operates differently and totally “OUTSIDE OF” the framework of the Divinely established Celestial Lunar Solar Calendar system. Part of that reason is the fact that they desperately WANT to believe that the Papal “Saturday,” from the Revised Papal Gregorian Jesuit-produced Counterfeit Calendar’s “Sunday to Saturday” weekly cycle, that NEVER EXISTED in Roman Calendar history until Oct., 1582, which “Weekday Format” DID NOT EXIST at any time during the 1st Century when Christ the Creator of Planet Earth, and of the True Biblical weekly 7th day Sabbath [walked the earth as a member of the Human Race for 33 ½ years], nor at the Time of the Exodus when Christ reinstated His Lunar Solar Calendar with their 4 Lunar Solar Weekly Sabbaths [that occur on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days of the month]as I have just shown to have been the case in the 2nd Biblical Lunar Solar month of Iyar/Zif from the context of content found in Ex. 16, and have also shown to be the case [on p. 16 of this current document] for the Biblical 1st month of Abib, [later called Nisan from the time of the Babylonian Captivity Esther 3: 7].

    It was this same Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar that Christ reinstituted among the Hebrews during the Month of Abib [Ex. 12: 1; 13: 4] with their 4 Lunar Solar Weekly Sabbaths that occur on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days of the month that He and the Jews of the 1st Century were keeping throughout His 33 ½ year lifetime on Earth during the 1st Century A.D., and which the Jews were still keeping at the time of the Crucifixion to Resurrection day Scenario during the 1st Biblical Lunar Solar Month of Abib/Nisan in A.D. 31 as is clearly demonstrateable from the contents of the New Testament record found in Jn. 19: 14, 30-31, that ALL of the NAYSAYERS who decry the concept of Biblical Lunar Solar weekly Sabbaths that occur on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days of the Biblical Lunar Solar months as a “Satanic Delusion” of these last days of earth’s history and as “Damnable Heresy.”

    What this amounts to, is that they are systematically referring to the Creator’s True Celestial Calendar and how it operates, as being a “Satanic Delusion” of these last days of earth’s history and as “Damnable Heresy.” It is serious business to accuse the Creator of the Universe, Christ Jesus, of generating a Calendar System the contents of the 4 weekly cycles of which, they choose to rise up against and refer to as a “Satanic Delusion” and as “Damnable Heresy,” ALL BECAUSE they WANT to believe no matter what in the  true “Satanic Delusion” and the true “Damnable Heresy” is that the Papal Gregorian  weekly cycle is the Creator’s True 7 day weekly cycle from Creation Week and that “Saturday,” found in the Counterfeit Satanically motivated, Jesuit-produced Papal Gregorian Calendar’s 7th day of the week is the Creator’s True weekly 7th day Sabbath that MUST BE CONSISTENTLY KEPT all 52 weeks that it appears on the Gregorian Calendar system, - [even when in ALL Gregorian years, that Gregorian Calendar has 28, 30 and 31 day months in it, when the True Biblical Calendar has ONLY 29 and 30 day months, which Papal Gregorian Calendar also has the totally Anti-Biblical phenomenon of having 5 Gregorian months that have 5 consecutive Saturdays in them when NO Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar month has ever had 5 weekly 7th day Sabbaths in it], etc., and when every two Gregorian Years have 4 weeks too many in them that CORRESPOND TO NOTHING on any Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar. 

    Which is the True “Satanic Delusion” and the true “Damnable Heresy,” and WHO are the True “Satanically deluded people” who are the True “Damnable Heretics” on this Calendation Issue, who are systematically promoting Satanically devised Papal Gregorian Calendation Delusions among God’s professed people in these last days of earth’s history CONTRARY to the Plain teachings found in His Word on these controversial Calendar issues? Is it not those who are consistently promoting the Papal Gregorian 7th day “Saturday” that they say MUST BE kept all 52 weeks per Gregorian Calendar Year in order to be a True Biblical 7th day Sabbath Keeper, the TRULY DECEIVED people on this issue?

    While, to the  novice in Biblical Calendation issues, Shauna Manfredine’s reasoning on this issue, like that of Melody Drake on the same subject, may sound convincing, the Biblical evidence from Jn. 19: 14, 30-31, coupled with the statement by Ellen G. White in D.A., Chapter 80, In Joseph’s Tomb, p.  675, par. 2 totally shows their reasoning on this issue to be FALSE, as Ellen G. White, when talking about the day that Christ rested in Joseph’s tomb indicates that day was “Creation Sabbath,” and we know that the day following Passover day [Ex. 12: 6, and Lev. 23: 5], was Abib/Nisan 15, according to Lev. 23: 5-6. 

    The arguments against Abib 15/Nisan being a weekly 7th day Sabbath by Shauna Manfredine and Melody Drake and by anyone else who promulgates the same erroneous lines of reasoning about the 15th day of Abib/Nisan NOT being the weekly 7th day  Sabbath, is merely artificially and arbitrarily contrived so as to AVOID believing that the 4 Biblical 7th day Sabbaths ALL fall on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days of every Biblical month. The passage in Ex. 12: 16, quoted by Shauna Manfredine, however, says nothing about anyone cooking food that day! 

    Both Melody Drake and Shauna Manfredine and any other “Saturday”  Anti-Lunar Solar weekly Sabbath Naysayer have absolutely NO WIGGLE ROOM by which they can effectively try to wiggle their way out of it in Jn. 19: 14, 30-31.

    Here is the reasoning again from Jn. 19: 14, 30-31:

    1.    Passover occurs on the 14th of Abib or Nisan, [Ex. 12: 6-10; Lev. 23: 5], and that 1st Biblical  Lunar Solar month is a 30 day month.

    2.   As Passover takes place on the 14th day of the 30 day month of Abib/Nisan, that Biblical Lunar Solar monthly date obviously occurs near the end of the 2nd Lunar Solar weekly cycle, [for Jn. 19: 14, 42 clearly states that Christ was “Crucified on Preparation Day,” and we know from the context of Ex. 16: 5, 22-29  that Prepar-ation Day was the 6th day of the Biblical 7 day weekly cycle] - that a whole raft of Lunar Solar Feast Keepers quibble over, [who do not want to admit that the 4 Lunar Solar Weekly cycles with their 4 Lunar weekly 7th day Sabbaths that occur in the 7th day position of each of those 4 weekly cycles are governed by their position relative to New Moon Day, simply because they do not want to believe that the Lord’s 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths always occur on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days of each of His Lunar Solar monthly cycles that are each made up of 4 Lunar Solar Weekly cycles, each containing 7 lunar solar days, which 7 day weekly cycle logically ends with a lunar solar weekly 7th day Sabbath]. It cannot be otherwise! Otherwise there is NO SUCH THING as Lunar Solar Months or Years, or a Divinely established Lunar Solar Calendar, at all!

    Nevertheless, [despite all of their senseless quibbling over whether or not the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths in each Lunar Solar month are determined by their position in the month relative to Biblical New Moon Day], they do amazingly all agree that “Preparation Day” as indicated in Ex. 16, as being the 6th day of the Biblical 7 day weekly cycle [on which a double portion of manna was to be collected and baked into bread or cakes and all food preparations to be made for the following day which was the 7th day Sabbath], [see Ex. 16: 5, 22-29]. 

    Now chronic quibblers [like Melody Drake and Shauna Mnafredine and a host of otherFeast-Keeping SDAs as well as Feast-Keeping NON-SDAs], may quibble about this too, saying “but the Bible makes no mention of the term “Preparation day” in Ex. 16. That is true. It doesn’t mention the term or the phrase, but the inherent immediate context, clearly shows that the 6th day of the Biblical Lunar Solar Weekly cycle is indeed “Preparation Day,” [whether we want to quibble over the “exact phraseology” in the Biblical text or not], like some love to do, to make a negative point to reinforce their incredulity or to try to discredit the internal context of the Biblical Record!

    Hence, Passover Day, Abib/Nisan 14, is “the Preparation Day” [see Ex. 16: 5, 22-29], obviously, in the context of Jn. 19: 14, 30-31,  for the following day, Abib/ Nisan 15, [which is clearly the 7th day of that 2nd Biblical Lunar Solar weekly cycle in that 1st Lunar Solar month], and cannot be otherwise [as it is the 7th day of that 2nd Biblical weekly cycle], and is at the half-way point in a 30 day Biblical Lunar Solar monthly cycle, which clearly indicates that Abib/Nisan 15 is indeed the 2nd Biblical Lunar Solar weekly 7th day Sabbath for that 1st Biblical month, whether or not you wish to admit that to be true or simply wish to deny its truth. 

    The Biblical record is quite clear on this fact in Jn. 19: 3-31, and because Passover ALWAYS takes place in the 1st  Biblical month of Abib, [later called Nisan at the time of the Babylonia Captivity in the late 6th Century B.C],  it should be also obvious to all thinking, rational, logically-minded, 21st Century SDAs, that the Apostle John is NOT describing an event that Christians allege [including ALL of the “Saturday” Sabbatarian Churches who say that it was an event that took place on a “Friday” the 6th day Roman weekly cycle], but, which, rather, on the contrary, was an event taking place from the Biblical Lunar Calendar perspective, seeing that there is NO such month as Abib or Nisan in any Roman month during A.D. 31 or at any time in Roman  history from 753 B.C. to 1582.  That is an indisputable historical fact!

    3.  So, we have just established from the Biblical New Testament record found in Jn 19: 14, 30-31, that Abib/Nisan 14 was the 2nd last day of the 2nd Lunar Solar weekly cycle of that 1st Biblical month, and we have also established from Jn. 19: 30-31, that the day immediately following Passover, which we know to be Abib/Nisan 15, [the 1st Holy Convocation Sabbath for the Feast of Unleavened Bread],  because that same day is also the 7th day of the 2nd Biblical Lunar Solar weekly cycle, [due to the fact that Abib/Nisan 14 was the 6th day of that 2nd weekly cycle], is automatically the 2nd Lunar Solar weekly 7th day Sabbath. This day, Abib/Nisan 15 was Christ’s “Tomb Day.” 

    4.   This makes Abib/Nisan 16, the 1st Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar work day in the 3rd Lunar Solar Calendar weekly cycle, which, when you understand where that day occurred on a Roman 1st Century 8 day Nundinal Calendar, DID NOT FALL on a Roman “Sunday”. 

    Abib/Nisan 16 was Wave Sheaf day, Christ’s Resurrection day, and it corresponded to April 27 in the 4th week of the 1st Century Roman 8 day Julian Nundinal Civil Calendar in 31 A.D. That particular date corresponded to or occurred on a Monday in the 4th week of April, A.D. 31. It did not correspond to a Sunday!

    As I mentioned earlier in this document, Ellen G. White’s Statement in D.A., Chapter 80, entitled “In Joseph’s Tomb,” p. 676, par. 2, Christ’s “Tomb day,” which was the day immediately following Passover Day, was “Creation Sabbath,” which clearly shows that Shauna Manfredine’s position about the 15th of Abib NOT being a regular weekly 7th day Sabbath is TOTALLY ERRONEOUS! 

    Furthermore, the fact that in G.C., p. 399, pars. 3-4, Ellen G. White indicates that how the Jews were keeping Passover Day and the Feast of Unleavened Bread and Wave Sheaf Day, during Crucifixion Week, was exactly the same as their ancestors had celebrated it during the 15 Centuries prior to the 1st Century A.D., which clearly shows that even during the time of the Exodus, Abib 15 was the 2nd Weekly 7th day Sabbath in that Lunar Solar 1st Biblical month. 

    This automatically shows that ALL of the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths are Lunar Solar Weekly Sabbaths that occur on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days of the 1st Biblical month of Abib, later called Nisan because they all come exactly 7 days apart from one another with the 1st weekly 7th day Sabbath occurring exactly 7 days AFTER New Moon Day! Once you know the exact day that one of the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths fall on, it is easy to calculate and locate the other 3 weekly 7th day Sabbaths for the Biblical Lunar Solar Monthly Cycle.

    This also means that ALL Biblical Lunar Solar weekly Sabbaths ALWAYS OCCUR on those same Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar Dates of the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days even though many “Saturday” Sabbatarians try to refute the validity of those 4 Biblical Lunar solar Sabbaths so that they can ALL keep on perpetually observing the Papal Gregorian “Saturday” as the Biblical 7th day Sabbath when the Word of God clearly shows that His True Sabbaths ONLY occur on His Lunar Solar Calendar system and ONLY on His prescribed dates of the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days of the Biblical Lunar Solar month which is what Jn. 19: 14, 30-31 clearly indicates to be the case, but is something which most “Saturday Sabbatarians” DO NOT DESIRE or WANT to accept, believe or practice because it would be inconvenient in some way for some undisclosed reason to do so. 

    So, to avoid believing that the concept of Biblical Lunar Solar Weekly Sabbaths is how the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths per Lunar Solar monthly cycle works, people have to invent devious lines of reasoning to try to discredit that concept even though the Biblical record found in Ex. 16 and in Jn. 19 clearly confirm that this is how the Lord’s 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths work within the framework of His Lunar Solar Calendar construct. Most Lunar Solar Feast Keepers to ONLY use His Lunar Solar Calendar for His yearly worship days connected with His yearly religious festivals that ONLY OCCUR during 3 months of the year: Abib/Nisan, Sivan and Tishri/Ethanim. 

    None of then or very few of them appear to believe that New Moon Day is a Non-Commercial day [Amos 8: 5] when no buying or selling or business was to be transacted. It becomes obvious that one’s “financial self-interest” in the 21st Century is affecting their reasoning and beliefs on this issue. They all also seem to NOT really believe that New Moon Day is a Worship Day in which some types of work was allowed while Commercial business practices that took place during the regular 6 day work cycle per 7 day week was not allowed. Again, one’s financial self-interest is the motivation behind that type of reasoning whether it is admitted or not to be the case!

    In Ex. 40: 2, God commanded Moses to erect the Tabernacle on New Moon Day, the 1st day of Abib. Again the quibblers will say “but the term New Moon Day is not mentioned.” Quite true, but common sense logic and a good overall knowledge of how the Biblical Lunar Calendar operates clearly shows that New Moon Day is the 1st day of every Biblical month. Everyone who keeps the Lunar Solar Calendar for the Biblical yearly Festivals knows this fact of course.

    ALL of the 7th day Sabbatarian NAYSAYERS, know that if they go that route and begin to keep and to advocate weekly Lunar Solar Sabbaths, they will eventually find themselves to be ostracized from their “Saturday” Sabbatarian Church that they presently belong to, and will have NOBODY to fellowship with. That would be an emotional-social disaster for many “emotionally driven people.” 
    If they want to fellowship with people on the True Biblical Sabbath according to the Lord’s True Lunar Solar Calendar, however, they will have to scour the state or county, or province, that they live in to try to find a few rare people who believes as they do on this issue! Not being able to fellowship chronically and systematically with their regular group in their “Saturday” Sabbatarian Church, they will have to meet in “House Churches” like the early Christians did in the 1st Century A.D. when ostracized from the Jewish Synagogues, etc., by the religious leaders of their day.

    This is a polarizing Truth for these last days, that but only a small handful of people will be willing to accept and live by, at least while they are in the work force! Every man, woman and child will eventually be polarized on this issue when the Great Crisis over “ALL of the Lord’s True Worship days” from Lev. 23 will be in conflict with the days that Papal Rome has substituted in their place! Curiously, many 7th day Sabbatarians who are retired on a pension still refuse to accept this Biblical Lunar Solar weekly Sabbath truth even after it has been clearly and systematically explained to them. They can no longer use the workplace and the fear of losing their job as an excuse. For them, peer pressure and an irrational attach-ment to “Saturday” and years of going to Church every “Saturday” becomes an overriding factor. They obviously are more interested in following their former worship habits than they are in following what is truth on this issue! For many, truth is okay just as long as it doesn’t “cramp their style” as we say!

    Hence, in spite of all of the statements that SDAs love to quote from Ellen G. White’s writings about “Saturday” being the Sabbath, she, like all of the Millerites, [who consequently accepted the concept that the 7th day of the Week position “Saturday” found on the calendar in their day that had Sunday as the 1st Day of the week and “Saturday” in the 7th day position of the week], who had accepted the Gregorian calendar “Saturday” as the Biblical 7th day Sabbath of the 4th Command-ment, subsequent to Joseph Bates’ pamphlet on the subject in 1846, mistakenly came to believe in the Papal False Propaganda about the Bible enforcing “Saturday” as the Sabbath, a day which the Catholic claim they subsequently changed to Sunday, the 1st day of the week.

    SDAs all think that Ellen G. White’s Statement about “Saturday” being the True Bible Sabbath MUST be correct! After all, wasn’t she the Lord’s End-Time prophet? 

    Because I believe in and advocate Biblical Weekly Lunar Solar Sabbaths, and because the way that the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar operates, I only go to church on “Saturday” when “Saturday” falls on one of the Lord’s 4 weekly Lunar Solar weekly 7th day Sabbath timeslots which only 4 to 8 weeks per Gregorian yearly cycle corresponds to a Gregorian 7th day “Saturday,” I am often falsely accused of NOT being a 7th day Adventist because I don’t systematically go to Church every Papal Gregorian Calendar “Saturday,” and I am often falsely accused of NOT believing in the writings of Ellen G. White on this subject. It seems that for most Seventh-day Adventists these days, if you are not systematically observing the Papal Gregorian Calendar “Saturday,” you are not a true SDA.

    What Ellen G. White herself did NOT KNOW at any time in her 70 year Prophetic Ministry, , when she made those statements about “Saturday” being the weekly 7th day Sabbath was that Jesus Himself NEVER KEPT even ONE 7th day “Saturday” Sabbath in His day, because there was NO Roman 7th day “Saturday” in the 7th day of their weekly cycle in either of their 1st Century Calendars for the 7th day Biblical Sabbath that He was obviously keeping  - [according to the same Lunar Solar Calendar He had given to the Hebrews through Moses at the time of the Exodus], TO CORRESPOND TO simply because, a 7th day position Roman “Dies Saturnis” = “Saturday” DID NOT EXIST in His day that could ever correspond to the Biblical 7th day Sabbath in His Divinely established Lunar Solar Calendar! 

    That is an historical fact that  practically all 7th day “Saturday” Sabbatarians appear to be totally unaware of, which fact Ellen G. White was unaware of, and just as 99.99% of the 500+ “Saturday” Sabbatarian Churches and their membership who do not have any access to the writings of Ellen G. White, and who most likely wouldn’t believe in them anyway, are also totally unaware of. 

    What chronic SDA “Saturday” Sabbatarian Naysayers who try to either refute the validity of the Lunar Solar Calendar completely, or who if they do believe in that Biblical Calendar Construct, try to refute the inherent concept of “Lunar Solar weekly 7th day Sabbaths being an integral component of the Lunar Solar Calendar system, need to contemplate, is, what do the other 500+ Non-SDA perpetual “Saturday” Sabbatarians base their belief in a perpetual “Saturday” Sabbath on? They can’t look up books by Ellen G. White and try to buttress their faith and belief in a “Saturday” Sabbath on a few statements that she wrote on the subject, statements that were written without her knowing anything about the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar which NONE of the Millerites of  her day ever kept, and statements that were made by her without her ever realizing that the whole Biblical record is written from the Bible’s own internal Lunar Calendar perspective and Not from a Papal Gregorian “Sunday to Saturday” weekly cycle perspective that didn’t exist in the 1st Century A.D. nor at any time in Roman Calendar history from 753 B.C. to 1582 A.D. 

    She wrote about what she thought was true concerning what days the Crucifixion to Resurrection scenario took place on, based on the weekday layout that she saw displayed in the Papal Gregorian Calendar that everyone in North America had been using since 1620, and based on 17 years of Methodist Church programmIng by which she had been taught as a Methodist, the same Papal Prop-aganda statements about the Bible enforcing a 7th day Saturday Sabbath, about the Jews having enforced a “Saturday” Sabbath for thousands of years, about the Cruci-fixion to Resurrection scenario allegedly having taken place in a Friday/ Saturday/ Sunday sequence, and about the Church of Rome claiming to have changed what they allege to have been the Biblical 7th day  “Saturday” Sabbath to “Sunday,” the 1st day of the week, which they claim is the New “Christian” Sabbath of the alleged “New Law.” 

    She had no idea when she wrote that “Saturday” is the Sabbath, that there is NO SUCH THING as a 7th day “Saturday” Sabbath presented anywhere in Scripture. She had NO IDEA that there was NO SUCH THING as a 7th day “Saturday” in any Roman Calendar in the 7th day position of any of their weekly cycles in either of their two types of Roman Calendar Construct in the 1st Century A.D., or that Christ Himself, and NONE of the Jews of His generation ever kept or ever could keep throughout t he 1st Century A.D. or during Crucifixion Week, to an alleged Roman 7th day of the week “Saturday” that NEVER EXISTED during their lifetime.

    SDAs and other 7th day “Saturday” Sabbatarians who ONLY KNOW about the Papal Gregorian “Sunday to Saturday” weekly cycle that didn’t exist prior to Oct., 1582, have absolutely no idea that this Gregorian weekly cycle did not exist from the time of the Exodus to Oct., 1582. That is approximately a period of 3082 years give or take a few years. There were NO Roman calendars at all prior to 753 B.C. when the city of Rome was allegedly founded. But we do know that during the 165-166 year period from 84 B.C. to 81 A.D. [B.C.E/C.E.] there were between 8580 to 8632 continuous Roman weekly cycle, and that during all that time there wasn’t a single Roman weekly cycle that had “Saturday” in the 7th day position of it.

    That period included the 133-134 year period of the Roman Occupation of Palestine between the years 63 B.C. to A.D. 70. All throughout that 133-134 year period there were 6916 to 6968 Roman weekly cycles neither of which ever had “Saturday” in the 7th day position of any of their weekly cycles. During the 1st 31 years of the 1st Century A.D. there were 1612 Roman weekly cycles. Christ was alive  during 99,99% of that time span, being executed on the 1st day of the 4th week in the Julian 8 day Civil Calendar during the 4th Roman month of April in the year A.D. 31. That execution day occurred on April 25 which occurred on a Roman Julian “Saturday,” the 1st day of the Roman Julian 8 day Calendar 4th weekly cycle – NOT on a Roman “Friday” where Papal Rome says it took place. A Roman “Friday” was the 7th day of the Roman weekly cycle in both types of Roman Calendar formats used throughout the 1st Century A.D., NOT the 6th day of the week where we see Friday today in our Papal Gregorian Calendars. Consequently, according to the weekday layout of the Roman 1st Century Julian 8 day Civil Calendar, Christ’s “Tomb Day” would not have occurred on a “Saturday” [which was the 1st day of the Roman weekly cycle, not the 7th day of the Roman weekly cycle], but on a Sunday which was the 2nd day of the Roman weekly cycle and NOT the 1st day of the Roman weekly cycle as it presently appears in our current Papal Gregorian Calendar. His Resurrection day, therefore, that occurred on April 27, would have occurred on a Roman “Monday” the 3rd day of the Roman weekly cycle and NOT on a “Sunday,” the 2nd day of the Roman weekly cycle. 

    On a 7 day Roman 1st Century Planetary Week Astrological Calendar construct, those three days of April 25, 26, 27 that corresponded to the three Lunar Solar Calendar days of Abib/Nisan 14, 15, 16, during which the Crucifixion to Resurrection scenario took place on the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar, would have corresponded to a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday sequence. Either way, both Roman 1st Century Calendar Construct disprove the Papal Friday/Saturday/Sunday sequence so fundamental to the belief system of both Saturday Sabbatarians and Sunday keepers relative to their respective weekly day of worship, because neither of those two days of worship are based on Christ’s Lunar Solar Calendar System. Herein lies the rub!

    Furthermore, the Roman 7 day Planetary week Astrological Calendar and the Roman 8 day Julian Nundinal Calendar were NOT generated by Christ, the Creator – but by the Pagan Romans who worshipped NON-EXISTENT Planetary “deities”: [i.e.,  Saturn, Sol, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus in that order! He could NEVER ENDORSE a calendar that didn’t recognize His authority as the Creator of the Universe, or a pagan calendar construct that honored NON-EXISTENT planetary “gods” instead. None of those two 1st Century Roman Calendars are the Lord’s True Calendar system because neither of them are Lunar Solar Calendars – the ONLY calendar system that the word of God systematically supports from Gen. 1: 1 to Rev. 22: 21.

    NOR would He ever tell Ellen G. White that the Day in the 7th day position of a Calendar Construct that wouldn’t even exist until it was brought forth by the Power that He had His Prophet, Daniel, describe in Dan. 7: 25 as the Power that would totally alter His True Calendar [on which all of His Holy Days, including His weekly 7th day Sabbaths are to be found], was His True weekly 7th day Sabbath that MUST be systematically kept on that Counterfeit Calendar construct devised by papal Rome in Oct., 1582, which day, “Saturday,” that honors the pagan Roman Planetary god, “Saturn,” whose worship day was known as “Dies Saturnis,” = “the day of Saturn,” which we all know as the Papal Gregorian “Saturday” – a day which He NEVER EVER kept during the entire 33 ½ years that He lived on Planet Earth during the 1st Century CE., simply because it DIDN’T EXIST to be kept, in the 7th day of the week Roman timeslot that well-meaning, yet deceived, “Saturday” Sabbatarins systematically keep it in ignorance today where it is found perpetually in the 7th day of the week timeslot on our Papal Gregorian Calendar, and which day wouldn’t have been systematically kept by Him because the Calendar that He created for Humanity wouldn’t ever permit any single day on a foreign, totally pagan calendar construct to be perpetually kept as the weekly 7th day Sabbath because of How His Calendar system works – a method that is in total opposition to the way that the humanly devised pagan calendars throughout history have worked.

    5.  Most Christians in general, and most SDAs, as well as other “Saturday” Sabbatarians haven’t considered these following facts in this case either:

    As previously noted earlier in this study, Abib/Nisan 14 [which was Passover Day = Crucifixion Day] and Abib/Nisan 15 [which was Christ’s [Tomb Day], which occurred on the 6th day and the 7th days respectively of the 2nd Biblical Lunar Solar weekly cycle for the month of Abib/Nisan, which two days corresponded to April 25 and April 26  respectively in the 4th weekly cycle of the 4th Roman month of April, whereas Abib/Nisan 16, [which was “Wave Sheaf Day” = Christ’s “Resurrection Day,”], actually occurred on the 1st work day of the following 3rd Biblical Lunar Solar 7 day weekly cycle, which event corresponded to April 27,  which was the 3rd day of the week in the 4th week of the 4th Roman Julian 8 day Civil Calendar month of April in A.D. 31. 

    If you look closely at the time span spread between each of the three days involved in the Crucifixion to Resurrection sequence and where they occurred respectively in the two totally different calendar systems, you will clearly see that there is an 11 day time span differential for those same 3 day events when the dates of Abib/Nisan 14, 15, 16 are compared to April 25, 26, 27, and where they would have occurred in the 4th Roman week in the 4th Roman month of April that same year in A.D. 31 [or C.E. 31]. 

    Thus, you have:

    the 14th day of the Biblical month versus the 25 day of the Roman month

    the 15th day of the Biblical month versus the 26 day of the Roman month

    the 16th day of the Biblical month versus the 27th day of the Roman month

    which means that each of those days are exactly 11 days apart as to where they occur in the two respective monthly cycles in the two different types of Calendar System [even though the three events occur in “a 3 day consecutive block of time” in both calendar systems]. I bet you haven’t noticed that before!

    If you look closely at events in the Biblical record, you will notice that the three Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar dates straddle two different Biblical weeks: the 6th and 7th days of the 2nd Biblical weekly cycle versus the 1st day of the 3rd Biblical weekly cycle, whereas their corresponding dates of April 25, 26, 27 ALL OCCUR as the 1st 3 days in the 4th weekly cycle in the 4th Roman month of April, A.D. 31, which on the 8 day Julian Civil Calendar fell on a Saturday, Sunday, Monday sequence as the 1st three days of its 4th weekly cycle are in harmony with the “Saturday to Friday” layout of the Roman weekly cycles in the 1st Century A.D. 

    Because the Roman 7 day Planetary Week Astrological calendar is different by one day, not having the letter “H” as an additional 8th day indicating market day which did exist in the Julian 8 day Calendar week, the three Roman dates of April 25, 26, 27 would have fallen in a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday sequence on a 1st Century Roman 7 day Planetary Week Calendar, which shows that a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sequence on a Roman Calendar Construct for April, C.E. 31, is incorrect, just as the Papal “Friday, Saturday, Sunday” sequence for those same three day events is also incorrect.

    This clearly shows that there is a major distinctive time alinement difference between the two very different calendar systems. The two Calendar systems are definitely NOT IDENTICAL The ONLY commonality that they share is that they both have a 7 day weekly cycle and a 12 month yearly cycle, most years. Other than that, they are as different as night and day.

    Now, Melody Drake, desperate to support her belief in a “Friday, Saturday, Sunday” Crucifixion to Resurrection day sequence, because she DOES NOT want to give up the False Papal Propaganda sequence for those same events, has attempted to project those three day events into the 5th Roman month of May in A.D. 31. 

    So, she goes to the Papal Gregorian Calendar which deleted 10 days from its calendar in Oct., 1582, and senselessly projects that missing 10 days back to the Roman 5th month of May in order to arrive at an alleged “Friday” Crucifixion date on the 15th of May. 

    This falsifies the data, because she is still thinking in terms of a Papal Gregorian “Sunday to Saturday” weekly cycle which didn’t exist back in the 1st Century A.D., NO matter what month you insist that the Crucifixion to Resurrection day sequence took place in on a Roman Calendar. 

    The reason is that as NONE of the Roman Calendars in the 1st Century A.D. ever had a “Sunday to Saturday” weekly cycle in them, [but instead had a “Saturday to Friday” day sequence in their weekly cycle], simply projecting the Papal Gregorian 7 day “Sunday to Saturday” weekly cycle from Oct., 1582, back unto a 7 day Planetary Week-style 1st Century Roman Calendar Construct for the Roman month of May, and then deleting the 10 days back there from the month of May is totally senseless, futile, and counterproductive, as the 10 day deletion process of the days from the NEW Oct., 1582 papal Gregorian Calendar in the late 16th Century A.D., has absolutely NO BEARING whatsoever on the events that took place during the 1st Century A.D.

    She just doesn’t see how senselessly illogical her reasoning on this issue is, because she is attempting to erroneously project a 10 day deletion event that took place almost 16 Centuries AFTER the actual events from Crucifixion Week in A.D. 31 had already transpired. NO future event subsequent to A.D. 31 CAN have any EFFECT whatsoever on what month of the year or days of the month on the Roman Calendar that the 3 day Biblical events of Abib/Nisan 14, 15, 16 during the 1st Biblical month took place on in A.D. 31. She just doesn’t understand that fact, nor does anyone influenced by her false line of reasoning on this issue. 

    People who have Website up claiming to TEACH THE TRUTH will bear a great responsibility if they are leading people astray and are falsely devising lines of reasoning to contravene anything found in the Biblical Record to support their personal erroneous religious presuppositions. I am sure that the Lord does not look favorably on anyone who is purposely contravening His word because they refuse to believe what His word actually says because it doesn’t fit their preconceived ideas on whatever topic.

    Therefore, there is NO WAY that she could ever arrive at the Papal “Friday, Saturday, Sunday” sequence that she hopes to thus achieve, as Friday was always the 7th day of the Roman Weekly cycle, and Saturday” the 1st day of the Roman weekly cycle, and “Sunday” was always the 2nd day of the Roman weekly cycle DURING ALL MONTHS and YEARLY CYCLES back in the 1st Century A.D., which would mean that despite of her best efforts to contravene Scripture and to explain away what it actually reveals, the best she could hope to achieve would be a Friday – 7th day of the Roman weekly cycle Crucifixion Day, a “Saturday” – a 1st day of the Roman next weekly cycle, ”Tomb Day,” and a “Sunday” – the 2nd day of the next Roman weekly cycle Resurrection Day, which while that is what her manipulating of the month of May in A.D. 31 would  have led to, because she thinks she has established an historical foundation and justification of the Papal “Friday,” “Saturday,” “Sunday” Crucifixion to Resurrection day sequence [which would ONLY WORK if the Papal Gregorian weekday sequence existed in the Roman Calendars in A.D. 31] which the Roman Calendar artifacts for the 1st Century clearly show that it didn’t! 

    As the Roman calendars had a “Saturday to Friday” sequence to them, she cannot achieve a 6th  day of the Roman week Friday Crucifixion, followed by a 7th day “Saturday” tomb day, followed by a 1st day of the week “Sunday” Resurrection day that she hopes to achieve based on her having totally accepted the False Papal Propaganda about the Crucifixion to Resurrection Day scenario as having transpired in a “Friday/Saturday/Sunday” sequence which can ONLY BE SUPPORTED on their own New Papal Gregorian Calendar brought forth in Oct., 1582, which “Sunday to Saturday” weekly cycle construct DID NOT EXIST in any of the Roman 1st Century Calendars, but which Papal Gregorian “Sunday to Saturday” weekly cycle would have had to have been in existence in A.D. 31 for her attempted manipulations of the Roman 5th month of May to have had any hope of being valid. 

    But as the Roman Calendar artifacts for the 1st Century B.C./A.D. [B.C.E./C.E] all clearly indicate a perpetual “Saturday to Friday” weekday layout [designated on the Roman Calendar artifacts with the Roman letters A,B,C,D, E,F,G], those 1st Century Roman Calendar Artifacts totally prove her attempted manipulation of the Roman 4th month of May [in order to try to achieve and support the Papal “Friday/Saturday/Sunday” Crucifixion to Resurrection day sequence], to be totally incorrect! 

    Therefore her whole line of reasoning doesn’t have a leg to stand on because it is totally false, - the work of a person who “TWISTS” the truth to make it fit her preconceived erroneous ideas because she doesn’t want to accept what the Biblical Record teaches on the subject of Lunar Solar Weekly Sabbaths which make her ideas about a Perpetual Gregorian “Saturday” being the True Bible Sabbath impossible to be perpetually kept on that day because of how the Lord’s Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar actually operates. 

    One of the reasons that she can’t get her scheme to work is that she has deleted 10 days from the Roman 5th month of May in A.D. 31 to arrive back to May 15, which makes absolutely no logical sense, as what happened in Oct., 1582, and the deletion of 10 days from that month in the late 16th Century has NO BEARING on the events during Crucifixion Week in A.D. 31, as previously noted! The Papal 10 day deletion only affected the month of October, 1582, NOT the month of May, and even it had involved the month of May in 1582, nobody can transfer a time sequence from the future back into the past and attempt to reconstruct the past in function with changes that wouldn’t occur until 15 ¾ Centuries into the future! It makes good science fiction, but it makes no logical sense when one tries to adapt that type of procedure to past tense historical events.

    You CANNOT GO BACK IN TIME and delete 10 days without falsifying the number of the days in the 5th Roman month of May to NO AVAIL, because those days CAN NOT be deleted back then, as the changes to the Gregorian Calendar affected the month of October in the late 16th Century A.D., NOT the month of May of that same 16th Century Calendar system. Melody Drake is really “Grasping after Straws” to promote “an erroneous set of premises” as truth, all because she refuses to accept that the Biblical record in Ex. 16 and in Jn. 19 both support Lunar Solar Weekly Sabbaths that occur on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days of the Biblical month – something that she does not want to admit, accept, or practice!

    Furthermore, both she and Shauna Manfredine believe in an endless cycle of weeks with no breaks between the weeks or the months. That false concept contravenes and totally contradicts the content of Scripture.

    As there are only 2 types of Biblical months: 29 day months and 30 day months, to make their weekly 7th day Sabbaths FALL on a series of 4 weekly dates other than the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar dates of the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days, [which is where the Biblical record clearly indicates in Ex. 16 and in Jn. 19 that they occur], they both have to have them fall on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th days of the Biblical Lunar Solar month, and in order to achieve this seamlessly, they would have to make all of the months of the Biblical year, 28 day months to have no days unaccounted for [as they currently perceive the 1st day of the month and the 30th day to the following next month’s  New Moon Day], which days they refer to as “NON DAYS.”

    Where is it recorded in the Word of God that the Lord’s Calendar contains “NON DAYS” every month, [i.e., New Moon Day, and the 30th day of 30 day months and however many days there are till the Next New Moon Day, the 1st day of the Next Biblical Lnnar monthly cycle occurs? These are artificial contrivances by people who refuse to accept the Biblical Record as it is on this issue.

    In order for their scheme of endless days and weeks to work within a Biblical Lunar Solar framework, they would have to include New Moon Day as the 1st day of the 1st 7th day weekly cycle per month, making it “an integral regular work day” among the 6 work days that comprise 6/7 of a 7 day weekly cycle - a process that Ez. 46: 1-7 forbids. Ez. 46: 1-7 clearly shows New Moon Days and Sabbaths to be “Worship Days” that are separate from the regular 6 day work week. But rebellious people who wish to disbelieve the Biblical record and enforce their own ideas on Scripture to make it read as they want it to read and not as it actually reads invent all sorts of devious lines of reasoning to skirt around the contents of the Biblical record. 

    While that procedure existed in the Babylonian Calendar, it NEVER has existed at any time in the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar. 

    It is amazing to what lengths people will go in self-deception and deviousness when they do not want to believe what the Word of God actually teaches on any subject! The problem is, they both have a following, and are both deceiving other people with their erroneous articles on this subject.

    By trying to insert New Moon Day into the 1st 7 day weekly cycle in order to try to get 4 consecutive 7 day weeks in a row so that the 4 monthly 7th day Sabbaths will occur on the 7th, 14th, 15th, and 29th days of the month, where they have never occurred in Scripture, so as to contravene the Biblical dates of the 8th, 15th, 22nd and 29th days of the month that the Bible actually reveals in Ex. 16 and Jn. 19, they do avoid not knowing what to do with New Moon Day. But in making New Moon Day the 1st of the 6 regular work days, they are denying two concepts shown in Scripture: (1) they are making it a regular, standard, business work day whereas the Bible clearly reveals in Amos 8: 5 that it is clearly a Non-Commercial day when no business is to be transacted; and (2) they are eliminating the Biblical concept that New Moon Day is a worship day and a day that is in a separate category both from the weekly Sabbaths and the 6 regular work days as the Eastern Gate of the tabernacle was to be open to the people for worship ONLY on New Moon Days and Sabbaths and closed all other days. In fact, Ez. 46 clearly reveals that more sacrifices and offerings were to be offered up on New Moon Day than any day of the month, even more than on the weekly 7th day Sabbaths.

    Some people have said to me:

    “I am wondering if you still believe in Spirit of Prophecy.  If so, how do you see the sunday law and the mark of the beast?  How do we reconcile the many times Sister White uses the word Saturday and the first day of the week being the mark.”

    My answer to that question, is that Ellen G. White’s belief that “Saturday” is the True Bible Sabbath is clearly incorrect because it disagrees with Scripture as “Saturday” is NEVER EVEN ONCE located anywhere in Scripture, and it also runs totally contrary to the historical/ archeological Roman Calendar evidence between the years 84 B.C. to 81 A.D. that incorporates the 133-134 year Roman Occupation of Palestine during the years 63 B.C. to 70 A.D, that clearly shows in all three Roman Calendar artifacts from that span of time in Roman/Jewish history, that the Roman weekly cycle ALWAYS had a “Saturday to Friday” weekly cycle and not our Papal Gregorian “Sunday to Saturday” weekly cycle. 

    Because of the way that both Roman Calendar weekly cycles were laid out in the 1st Century A.D., it is TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE for “Saturday” that was NON-EXISTENT in the 7th day position of either of the Roman Calendars during that century to have been “the Creation Sabbath” tomb day that Ellen G. White thought it was in her statement in D.A., Chapter 80, In Joseph’s Tomb, par. 2.

    In other statements, Ellen G. White talks about the controversy being over “The True Biblical 7th day Sabbath” versus the Papal Sunday. The problem is, 99% of the Papal Gregorian yearly cycle, the Papal “Saturday” DOES NOT constitute “The True Biblical 7th day Sabbath” simply because the Biblical Lunar Cycle set up by the Creator will not allow it to happen, due to the fact that His 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths per month in His Lunar Solar monthly cycle start off with the 1st one occurring exactly 7 days from New Moon Day. This means that what ever day the Biblical New Moon Day corresponds to on the Gregorian Calendar that we are using today, that specific day CAN NEVER BE a weekly 7th day Sabbath, but all of the Lord’s true weekly 7th day Sabbaths per month will fall on that exact same day in that Gregorian month, but the 1st one will occur exactly 7 day after New Moon Day on the same day of our Gregorian Weekly cycle in all 4 weekly cycles per month. This is why it is totally impossible, for instance, in the 5 Gregorian months of January, April, July, October and December, [all of which have 5 Consecutive “Saturdays” in them], for the 1st “Saturday” in that consecutive series of 5 to ever be a legitimate Biblical weekly 7th day Sabbath, because that 1st weekly “Saturday” is the Biblical New Moon Day if New Moon Days happens to fall on that day in our Gregorian Calendar that particular month, and we know from Scripture that New Moon Day, being the 1st day of every Biblical monthly Lunar Solar cycle NEVER OCCURS on a 7th day Sabbath because every 1st weekly 7th day Sabbath per month ALWAYS FALLS on the 8th day of every Biblical month, and NEVER on the 1st day of the month. That is an indisputable Biblical fact that both regular “Saturday” Sabbatarians and ALL Hybrid “Saturday” Sabbatar -ian/Lunar Solar Feast Keepers denounce as a Satanic Delusion” and as “Damnable Heresy.” The accusations are  misplaced because they are the deluded ones due to the fact that they obviously do not yet understand the Biblical Calendar correctly or refuse to observe as the Word of God prescribes due to some personal agenda of their own that they want to pamper.

    Ellen G. White says in 2MR, p. 197, 1890; LDE, p. 1

    “This time when there is such an effort made to enforce the observance of Sunday, is the very opportunity to present to the world the true Sabbath in contrast to the false. The Lord in His providence is far ahead of us. He has permitted the Sunday question to be pressed to the front that the Sabbath of the fourth command-ment may be presented before the legislative assemblies. Thus the leading men of the nation may have their attention called to the testimony of God’s Word in favor of the true Sabbath.” 2MR, p. 197, 1890; LDE, p. 1

    Again I repeat for emphasis, , The Lord’s True weekly 7th day Sabbath was established at Creation Week when the Papal System and its counterfeit “Sunday to Saturday” weekly cycle clearly did not exist. There was NO “Saturday” in the 7th day position of Creation Week as the Papal Gregorian Calendar weekly cycle would have had to have existed at that time for the Papal Claim that the Bible enforces a “Saturday” Sabbath to be true and valid, especially as it only exists in the Papal Roman Gregorian Calendar format – the only Roman Calendar format that has elapsed or transpired during a 1627-1628 year time span from 45 B.C. to Oct., 1582. 

    Hence, as the Papal Gregorian Calendar system with its “Sunday to Saturday” weekday sequence clearly “NEVER EXISTED” in the 1st Century A.D. when Christ, the Creator of the Sabbath lived on Planet earth for 33 ½ years, Nor did it exist either during the Exodus, when He re-established His Lunar Solar Calendar among the Hebrews starting with the 1st Biblical month of Abib,  That should tell all Naysayers that their position on this subject is INCORRECT! But people love to worship the idol of their own opinion which causes them to contravene and deny Scripture on this subject!

    There are a lot of things that I know about what took place in the 1st Century C.E. . when Christ was alive on the earth, and the fact that He DID NOT keep and COULD NOT keep a NON-EXISTENT “Saturday” Sabbath that ALL 21st Century Papal Gregorian Calendar-oriented “Saturday” Sabbatar-
    ians including Melody Drake and Shauna Manfredine, just to name two SDAs that I know among many others, that KNOW absolutely nothing about what the Roman Calendars looked like and operated like in the 1st Century A.D., and who haven’t thoroughly studied Jn. 19 with the accompanying commentaries by Ellen G, White on the events being described in that chapter. Otherwise they would not be making the senseless incorrect pontifications about these issues if they truly understood them correctly, and if they do know these things, then they are being openly dishonest about the whole issue because they WANT to BELIEVE A LIE on this subject so that they don’t have to eat theological and historical crow and admit that they were wrong about some of the positions that they have prematurely taken before examining all of the facts. Every professing Christian needs to do an in depth study, weighing all of the evidence for and against this vitally important issue, like a good Biblical Berean in the 1st Century would have done, before making a crucial final decision on this controversial topic.

    Is “Sunday” the Mark of the Beast? What does Sister White have to say on that issue? Here is a very interesting statement that she made as recorded in LDE, 8T., p. 159; CH., p. 520; LDE, p. 17; 6T., p. 17.

    “The mark of the beast is exactly what it has been proclaimed to be; NOT ALL in regard to this matter is YET UNDERSTOOD, and WILL NOT be understood UNTIL the unrolling of the scroll;…” 8T., p. 159; CH., p. 520; LDE, p. 17; 6T., p. 17.

    The end-time crisis, is much more involved than a simple “True Biblical 7th day Sabbath” versus “Sunday.” The “Spiritual Battle of Armageddon” mentioned in Rev. 16: 16 takes place during the 7th last plague and it involves ALL of the Lord’s Worship Days listed in Lev. 23. 

    As far as the majority of the SDA world is concerned, it only involves a “Saturday” versus “Sunday” issue. That’s all that they have been taught about the subject! That same similar view no doubt exist among the majority of the other 500+ Protestant “Saturday” Sabbatarian Churches in North America. Most of them do not keep the Lord’s Worship days of Lev. 23 according to His One and Only True Lunar Solar Calendar. They do however, have a couple of common threads that unite them: (1) they all practice a perpetual Gregorian Calendar-oriented weekly 7th day “Saturday” Sabbath, and (2) ALL without exception systematically believe the three levels of False Papal Propaganda concerning an alleged “Saturday” Sabbath that they insist the Bible teaches, and that they allege that the Jews were enforcing for thousands of years, which they then claim to have changed to “Sunday” the 1st day of the Week, and they believe in the False Papal Claim that the Crucifixion to Resurrection day scenario occurred in a Friday/Saturday/Sunday sequence. None of them appear to know that the Roman Calendars in the 1st Century A.D. [C.E.] makes that concept that originated with Papal Rome, TOTALLY IMPOSIBLE! 

    While “Sunday” is the day that, [when legislated in the USA as “a National Sunday Law”], will indeed make that Ecclesiastically recognized Mark of the Papal Power the most visible, recognizable aspect of the Mark of the Beast, other issues will be involved as well. 

    It will involve ALL of the Lord’s True Lunar Solar Calendar Holy Days all listed in Lev. 23 versus all of the days festival days, holy days, etc., endorsed and set up by Papal Rome. 

    While to the 7th day Adventist mind, like that of the people in the 500+ Protestant “Saturday” Sabbatarian Churches, , have been programmed to believe that the issue ONLY involves “Saturday” versus “Sunday,” [because they have fully accepted the Papal System’s 3 levels of False Propaganda on “the Sabbath to Sunday Issue], which has led them to falsely conclude that the Papal 7th day “Saturday” is the Biblical 7th day Sabbath everywhere that it shows up on the Gregorian Calendar [because they also falsely equate the Papal Calendar with the Biblical Calendar[, I can see and understand why they believe what they believe. It is because of the fact that they are totally imbibed with the 3 levels of Papal Propaganda on this Sabbath to Sunday controversy, and because they are totally ignorant of what the Roman weekly cycles in the Roman Calendars that existed during the 1st Century B.C. and A.D. [B.C.E/C.E.] LOOKED LIKE and how they functioned that they continue to believe in and to promote all three levels of that same False Papal Propaganda everywhere they go, in their evangelistic crusades, in their Daniel and Revelation seminars, etc.

    People often wonder why my documents on these Calendation issues are so long. It is clearly because I am trying to dismantle years of False Propaganda Programming that is so deeply entrenched in people’s mind that clearly takes a fair bit of time to explain, so that people can see clearly, that “Saturday” is  NOT “The True Biblical 7th day Sabbath” during most of the Gregorian yearly cycle because of several key reasons that cannot be logically denied or historically denied without being totally dishonest in mind and in understanding or without distorting the Biblical record in some way on this controversial issue:

    Here are the facts:

    a.  The Papal Gregorian Calendar has a perpetual 52 week 12 month yearly cycle ever since 45 B.C., whereas the Bible Calendar has a 52 week 13 month cycle ONLY ONCE every 3 years. All other years, The Biblical Calendar has a 12 month 48 week yearly cycle.

    b.   The Gregorian Calendar has 3 types of months: one 28 day month, Seven 31 day months and four 30 days months, whereas the Biblical calendar ONLY HAS 29 day months and 30 day months and NO 28 day months or 31 day months.

    c.    4 Gregorian 31 day months: January, July, October, and December + one 30 day month, April have 5 consecutive “Saturdays” per month which ALL “Saturday” Sabbatarians systematically worship on as though those 5 consecutive “Saturdays” constituted a True Biblical 7th day Sabbath in each of those 5 months – a phenomenon that could NEVER OCCUR in the Lord’s True Lunar Solar Calendar even if “Saturday” were His true 7th day Sabbath - [which it isn’t most of the year in our Gregorian yearly cycle] - simply because there is NO SUCH THING as 5 weekly 7th day Sabbaths in any Biblical Lunar Solar month. There NEVER HAS been such a thing in the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar construct, and the way that the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar functions would make it totally impossible for “Saturday” [as we see it displayed on our Gregorian Calendars all 52 weeks of the year[, to be perpetually every week, His True Weekly 7th day Sabbath, due to where the Biblical New Moon Day falls per month on the Gregorian Calendar system. That is a Biblical and historically undeniable fact. But when people willfully choose to contravene how the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar works, and the fact that the 1st weekly 7th day Lunar Solar Sabbath occurs on the same day that New Moon Day occurs on but ONE WEEK LATER, and NEVER OCCURS on the same day that New Moon Day falls on, they are purposely sidestepping the divine blueprint as to How His weekly 7th day Sabbaths are to operate and when and where they are to be located in His Lunar Solar monthly cycles, relative to the position of New Moon Day in those monthly ycles.

    ONLY the Papal Gregorian Calendar among the 5 types of Roman Calendars that have existed from 84 B.C. to 1582 has ever had that particular strange phenomenon of 5 Consecutive Saturdays in the 7th day position of all 52 of its weekly cycles per year, which is clearly a NON-Biblical Phenomenon, as well as the fact that ONLY the Papal Gregorian Calendar among the 5 types of Roman Calendars that have existed from 84 B.C. to 1582 has ever had a “Sunday to Saturday” weekday layout. 

    All of the other Roman Calendars during that same 1666-1667 year time span have all had a “Saturday to Friday” weekday layout. The Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar has NEVER HAD either one of those two pagan derived weekday layouts as NONE of those Roman day names no matter which layout is mentioned through-out Roman history EVER APPEARS in the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar or anywhere else in the Biblical record from Gen. 1: 1 to Rev. 22: 21. That is a Biblical and historically undeniable fact.

    Here are some other interesting facts about our Gregorian Calendar that you are no doubt unaware of. These are:

    If you look at our Gregorian Calendar for 2011 you will see that:

    1.   January has 5 Sundays, 5 Mondays, and 5 Saturdays in it. 

    2.   March has 5 Tuesdays, 5 Wednesdays, and 5 Thursdays in it.

    3. April has 5 Fridays and 5 Saturdays in it.

    4.  May has 5 Sundays, 5 Mondays, and 5 Tuesdays in it.

    5.   June has 5 Wednesdays and 5 Thursdays in it.

    6.  July has 5 Sundays, 5 Fridays, and 5 Saturdays in it.

    7.  August has 5 Mondays, 5 Tuesdays, 5 Wednesdays in it.

    8.  September has 5 Thursdays and 5 Fridays in it.

    9.  October has 5 Sundays, 5 Mondays, and 5 Saturdays in it.

    10.  November has 5 Tuesdays and 5 Wednesdays in it.

    11.   December has 5 Thursdays, 5 Fridays and 5 Saturdays in it.

    This type of phenomenon NEVER OCCURS in this way in the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar except when you line up Biblical New Moon Day with the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths. But, it must be duly noted that the Biblical New Moon Day is the 1st day of the Biblical Lunar Solar Month and NEVER a weekly 7th day Sabbath. All of the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths in the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar fall within the confines of the Same Biblical Lunar Solar monthly cycle and will NOT STRADDLE two separate Lunar Solar months. The 1st weekly 7th day Sabbath in every single Lunar Solar month will ALWAYS occur exactly 7 days AFER New Moon Day. It will NEVER fall on New Moon Day. That is a Biblical Calendar impossibility! That too is an indisputable Biblical fact!

    But when this Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar data is transferred over to the Papal Gregorian Calendar, [which is clearly NOT the Lord’s True Calendar System], whatever day on the Gregorian Calendar the Biblical New Moon Falls or Corresponds to, even when it falls on a Gregorian Calendar “Saturday,” as was the case this year on “Saturday” February 5, that  1st “Saturday” on February 5 WAS NOT the Biblical Lunar Solar weekly 7th day Sabbath because it was NEW MOON DAY, and NEW MOOD DAY is NEVER the 1st weekly 7th day Sabbath of the month even when the Gregorian “Saturday” falls on that timeslot. 

    Presumptuous SDAs and ALL Gregorian Calendar-oriented 7th day Sabbatarians have themselves erroneously convinced that every Gregorian “Saturday” is the Biblical weekly 7th day Sabbath, but this is clearly NOT the case, NOR CAN IT EVER BE the case. The True Lunar Solar Biblical 7th day Sabbaths straddle two Gregorian monthly cycles during the following Gregorian months: January to June inclusive.

    During those 6 Papal Gregorian months, the Biblical Lunar Solar 4 week Sabbaths will occur exactly one week subsequent to Biblical New Moon Day during the last 3 weeks in the 1st month and in the 1st week of the next Gregorian month that follows it.

    During the last 6 Gregorian Months of July to December, because of the number of days in those 6 Gregorian monthly cycles, and because of where the Biblical New Moon Day falls in each of those month, ALL 4 Lunar Solar Weekly 7th day Sabbaths will occur within the confines of each of those 6 Gregorian monthly cycles but, again,  the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths ONLY OCCUR beginning exactly 7 days subsequent to the day on which the Biblical New Moon Day falls in each of those 6 Gregorian  months. I only discovered that yesterday while studying these technicalities again for this document.

    Hence, for our Gregorian month of February, 2011, the 4 True Biblical Lunar Solar weekly Sabbaths actually fell on our Papal Gregorian Calendar “Saturday” on Feb. 12, 19, 26 and on “Saturday” March 5 and NOT ON “Saturday,” Feb. 5, 12, 19, 26 as ALL general 7th day “Saturday” Sabbatarians and as ALL “Hybrid Gregorian “Saturday” Sabbath/Lunar Solar Calendar yearly Feast Keepers kept it this year. The reason why Saturday, Feb. 5 was NOT a weekly 7th day Biblical Sabbath as Elder John L. Vandenburg has it displayed on His “Bible Exploration 2011 Calendar” on his website is because as Conjunction day for Feb., 2011 occurred on Thursday, Feb. 3, this made Biblical New Moon Day fall on the 1st Saturday of Feb., which was Feb. 5 and NOT on Friday, Feb. 4 where he has it placed on his Feast Day Calendar Construct for 2011.

    If you go on the www.Bibleexplorations.com website, , here is what John Vandenburg’s Feast Day Calendar for 2011 looks like:


    I want you to notice the following things about this 2011 Feast Day Calendar:

    1.   First of all, he doesn’t have his calendar set up displaying the 12 Biblical Lunar Solar months, but rather displaying the 12 Papal Gregorian months. [I don’t have a problem with that, per se] because he still looks for the Biblical New Moon Day the same way that I do.

    Notice that the pink block on his Calendar Chart is supposed to be the Biblical New Moon Day. In several months he has that pink slot put in the wrong place! 

    2.    When you compare “Conjunction Day” on our Gregorian Calendar for 2011, 
    that day shows up on:

    January - Conjunction Day is listed as Tuesday, Jan. 4, which means that Biblical New Moon Day will occur 2 days later on Thursday, Jan. 6, where it should be.

    February - Conjunction Day  is listed as Thursday, Feb.  3, which means that Biblical New Moon Day will occur 2 days later on Saturday, Feb. 5, where it should be. But Brother Vandenburg has Biblical New Moon Day listed incorrectly on his 2011 Biblical Feast Chart as occurring on Friday, Feb. 4, when it should have been Saturday, Feb. 5.

    March - Conjunction Day is listed as Friday, March 4, which means that Biblical New Moon Day will occur 2 days later on Sunday, March 6, where it should be.

    April - Conjunction Day is listed as Sunday, April 3, which means that Biblical New Moon Day will occur 2 days later on Tuesday, April 5, where it should be.

    May - Conjunction Day is listed as Tuesday, May 3, which means that Biblical New Moon Day will occur 2 days later on Thursday, May 5, where it should be.

    June - Conjunction Day is listed as Wednesday, June 1, which means that Biblical New Moon Day will occur 2 days later on Friday, June 3, where it should be.

    July - Conjunction Day is listed as Friday, July 1, which means that Biblical New Moon Day will occur 2 days later on Sunday, July 3, where it should be.

    August - Conjunction Day is listed as Saturday, July 30, which means that Biblical New Moon Day will occur 2 days later on Monday, August 1, where it should be.

    September - Conjunction Day is listed as Monday, August 29, which means that Biblical New Moon Day will occur 2 days later on Wednesday, August 31. [He has this one placed incorrectly because he places Biblical New Moon on his calendar for September as occurring on Aug. 30, when it should have been Wednesday, Aug. 31, two days after Conjunction day for Sept. which occurred on Monday, Aug. 29. 

    October - Conjunction Day is listed as Tuesday, Sept. 27, which means that Biblical New Moon Day will occur 2 days later on Thursday, Sept., 29. [He has this one placed incorrectly because he places Biblical New Moon on his calendar for October as occurring, Saturday, Oct. 1, when it should have been Thursday, Sept. 29. 

    November - Conjunction Day is listed as Wednesday, Oct. 26, which means that Biblical New Moon Day will occur 2 days later on Friday, Oct. 28. [He has this one placed incorrectly because he places Biblical New Moon on his calendar for November as occurring on Saturday, Nov. 26.

    December -  Conjunction Day is listed as Friday, Nov. 25 which means that Biblical New Moon Day will occur 2 days later on Sunday, Nov. 27. [He has this one placed incorrectly because he places Biblical New Moon on his calendar for November as occurring on Monday, Dec., 26 when it should have been Sunday, Nov. 27]. What Brother Vandenburg places as New Moon Day for December as occurring on Dec. 26 is really the Biblical  New Moon Day for January, 2012. 

    So, on 9 months of his 2011 Feast Calendar, he has the Biblical New Moon Day Correctly located. He just happened to miss the boat in Oct., Nov., and Dec. But in general, he and I are “on the same page” about “How to Locate the Biblical New Moon Day.” and WHEN the yearly Feast Days and their accompanying Holy Convocation Sabbaths begin and end, etc. 

    Where he and I will definitely differ is on this concept of perpetually keeping the Gregorian “Saturday” as the True Biblical weekly 7th day Sabbath, because on his 2011 Biblical Feast Calendar, he has what he currently believes to be every weekly 7th day Sabbath highlighted in a light blue color as ALWAYS occurring on a Gregorian “Saturday.”

    This means that in all of the Gregorian Months, where he has the True Biblical New Moon Day located on the Correct Gregorian day of the week, for the 9 months of January to September, the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths should be shown to occur on the following dates beginning on the very next week later  on the same Gregorian Calendar day that the Biblical New Moon Day occurred, if one is going to totally follow the Biblical record as to where they actually are to fall according to the content found in Ex. 16 and Jn. 19. 

    But unfortunately because of his inherent acceptance of many years of False Papal Propaganda about the Bible enforcing a 7th day “Saturday” Sabbath, which they allege to have changed to “Sunday” the 1st day of the week, coupled with their False Propaganda statement about a Friday/Saturday/Sunday Crucifixion to Resurrection Day scenario, which he has never relinquished or abandoned as yet, and appears to have no intention of abandoning any time soon, these levels of Papal Propaganda on this “Sabbath to Sunday” issues is clearly clouding his understand-ing and judgment and interpretation of the Biblical Record related not only as to how the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar works, but also concerning this false Papal concept of a perpetual “Saturday” being the 7th day Sabbath that the Biblical record enforces and that they allege that the Jews have always kept. Hence, it is not surprising that his calendar construct inadvertantly falsifies where the True Biblical Lunar Solar Sabbaths occur every week throughout the Papal Gregorian Calendar 52 consecutive week cycles per year.

    Notice the Bible Explorations Calendar for 2011:

    John Vandenburg’s Biblical New Moon Day + Saturday Sabbath Dates
    John Vandenburg’s Biblical New Moon Day + where the 4 Biblical weekly 7th day Sabbaths SHOULD be shown to occur according to the Lord’s True Lunar Solar Calendar:

    January - Biblical New Moon Day, - Thursday, Jan. 6  -  4 weekly Sabbaths are listed as occurring on Saturday, Jan. 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. 

    [Note: there are 5 consecutive “Saturdays” in this Gregorian month. ALL 5 of those “Saturdays” CANNOT POSSIBLY BE the True Biblical weekly 7th day Sabbath as NO Biblical Lunar Solar month has ever had 5 consecutive weekly 7th day Sabbaths in it].


    February -  Biblical New Moon Day -Friday, Feb.  4  - 4 weekly Sabbaths are listed as occurring on Saturday, Feb. 5, 12, 19, 28.










    March  -  Biblical New Moon Day – Sunday, March 6  - 4 Weekly 7th day Sabbaths are listed as occurring on Saturday, March 5, 12, 19, 28.


    April - Biblical New Moon Day – Tuesday, April 5 – the 4 Weekly 7th day Sabbaths are listed as occurring on Saturday, April  2, 9, 16, 23, 30. 

    [Note: there are 5 consecutive “Saturdays” in this Gregorian month. ALL 5 of those “Saturdays” CANNOT POSSIBLY BE the True Biblical weekly 7th day Sabbath as NO Biblical Lunar Solar month has ever had 5 consecutive weekly 7th day Sabbaths in it].

    May - Biblical New Moon Day – Thursday, May 5, - the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths are listed as occurring on Saturday, May 7, 14, 21, 28.


    June - Biblical New Moon Day – Friday, June 3, - the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths are listed as occurring on Saturday, June 4, 11, 18, 25.


    July - Biblical New Moon Day – Sunday July 3, - the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths are listed as occurring on Saturday,  July 2, 9, 16, 23, 30.

    [Note: there are 5 consecutive “Saturdays” in this Gregorian month. ALL 5 of those “Saturdays” CANNOT POSSIBLY BE the True Biblical weekly 7th day Sabbath as NO Biblical Lunar Solar month has ever had 5 consecutive weekly 7th day Sabbaths in it].

    August - Biblical New Moon Day – Monday, Aug. 1 – the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths are listed as occurring on Saturday,  6, 13, 20, 27.









    September -  Biblical New Moon Day – Sunday, Sept. 25 [Wrong Biblical New Moon Day. It should have been listed as Wednesday, Aug. 31 which was 2 days after Conjunction day on Monday, Aug.  29]. The 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths are listed as occurring on Saturday, 3, 10, 17, 24. 

    Also it should be noted that in this month near the end of September, Conjunction day is listed on the Gregorian Calendar as Tuesday, Sept. 27. This the Biblical New Moon Day for October, will occur on Thursday, Sept. 29 which is the Feast of Trumpets New Moon Day, called “Trumpets Sabbath.” 

    October - Biblical New Moon Day –  actually occurred on Thursday, Sept. 29 – the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths are listed as occurring on Saturday, Oct. 1, 8, 15, 22, 29.

    [Note: there are 5 consecutive “Saturdays” in this Gregorian month. ALL 5 of those “Saturdays” CANNOT POSSIBLY BE the True Biblical weekly 7th day Sabbath as NO Biblical Lunar Solar month has ever had 5 consecutive weekly 7th day Sabbaths in it].

    November - Biblical New Moon Day –  is listed as Friday, Oct. 28. The 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths are listed as occurring on Saturday, Nov., 5, 12, 19, 26.  But at the end of the month of November, the New Moon Day for December is incorrectly listed as occurring on Saturday, Nov. 26. It should have been listed as Sunday, Nov. 27 as Conjunction day for December is listed on the Gregor -ian Calendar month of November as occurring on Friday, Nov. 25]. 

    December -  Biblical New Moon Day – is incorrectly listed as taking place on Saturday, Nov. 26. It should have been listed as taking place on Sunday, Nov. 27, two days after Conjunction day for December which is shown on the Gregorian Calendar as occurring on Friday, Nov. 25.  The 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths for December are listed as occurring on Saturday, Dec. 3, 10, 17, 24, 31.

    [Note: there are 5 consecutive “Saturdays” in this Gregorian month. ALL 5 of those “Saturdays” CANNOT POSSIBLY BE the True Biblical weekly 7th day Sabbath as NO Biblical Lunar Solar month has ever had 5 consecutive weekly 7th day Sabbaths in it].

    As you can plainly see, the Gregorian Calendar has 5 months [January, April, July, October, December] which ALL have 5 consecutive “Saturdays” in them one of which, [even if the Biblical 7th day Sabbath were truly “Saturday,”] COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE a true weekly 7th day Sabbath simply because NO True Biblical Lunar Solar month has 5 Consecutive weekly 7th day Sabbaths in them. This issue MUST be HONESTLY dealt with.

    January - Biblical New Moon Day, - Thursday, Jan. 6  -  the 4 weekly Sabbaths should have been listed as occurring on Thursday, Jan. 13, 20, 27, and Thursday, Feb. 3.









    February -  Biblical New Moon Day Thursday, Feb.  3  - the 4 weekly Sabbaths should have been listed as occurring on Thursday,  Feb. 10, 17, 24, and Thursday, March 3.

    [Here is a true example of how the Biblical Lunar Solar 4 weekly Cycle system is supposed to work – New Moon Day followed by the 1st weekly 7th day Sabbath on the same day of the week but exactly 1 week later].


    March  - Biblical New Moon Day - Sunday, March 6 – the 4 Biblical weekly 7th day Sabbaths should have been listed as occurring on Sunday, March 13, 20, 27 and Sunday April 3.

    April  - Biblical New Moon Day – Tuesday, April 5 – the 4 Biblical weekly 7th day Sabbaths should have been listed as taking place on Tuesday, April 12, 19, 26, and Tuesday, May 3.








    May - Biblical New Moon Day – Thursday, May 5, - the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths should have been listed as occurring on Thursday, May 12, 19, 26, and Thursday, June 2. 

    June - Biblical New Moon Day – Friday, June 3, - the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths should have been listed as occurring on Friday, June 10, 17, 24, and Friday, July
    1.

    July - Biblical New Moon Day – Sunday July 3 - the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths should have been listed as occurring on Sunday, July 10, 17, 24, 31.









    August - Biblical New Moon Day – Monday, Aug. 1 – the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths should have been listed as occurring on Monday, August, 8, 15, 22, 29. 

    [Here is a true example of how the Biblical Lunar Solar 4 weekly Cycle system is supposed to work – New Moon Day followed by the 1st weekly 7th day Sabbath on the same day of the week but exactly 1 week later].

    September - Biblical New Moon Day – for September should  have been listed as having taken place on Wednesday, August 31, which was 2 days after Conjunction day listed on that same month as having occurred on Monday, Aug. 29. Hence, as the Biblical New Moon Day for September occurred on Wednesday, the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths for the month of September should have been listed as occurring on Wednesday, Sept. 7, 14, 21, 28.






    Biblical New Moon Day for October actually occurs on Thursday, Sept. 29 – The 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths should have been listed as occurring on Thursday, Oct. 6, 13, 20, 27.









    November - Biblical New Moon Day –  will take place on Friday, Oct. 28. The 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths therefore should be listed as taking place on Friday, Nov. 4, 11, 18, 25.








    December - Biblical New Moon Day for the month of December will take place on Sunday, Nov. 27. Therefore the 4 weekly 7th day Sabbaths should be shown as occurring on Sunday, Dec. 4, 11, 18, 25

    d.   Neither the Roman “Saturday to Friday” [1st Century B.C./A.D.] weekly cycle, Nor the Papal Gregorian “Sunday to Saturday” weekly cycle existed during Creation Week, NOR at the time of the Exodus when Christ reinstituted His Lunar Calendar weekly/monthly/yearly Lunar Solar cycle among the Hebrews as He was about to lead them up out of Egypt and into the Promised Land. 

    Neither of those two types of Roman Calendar weekly cycles exist anywhere in the Bible. That is an indisputable Biblical and historical fact, as NO Pagan Romans and NO Papal Romans with their respective NON-Biblical Solar Only weekly/monthly cycles existed during Creation Week, nor at the time of the Exodus or during the time of the 40 year trek that the Hebrews went through in their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land of Canaan.  That too, is an indisputable Biblical and historical fact!

    Those 4 key reasons mentioned in pts. a-d, clearly indicate that the Papal Gregorian weekly 7th day “Saturday” is  NOT “the True Biblical Sabbath” that is going to be in conflict with Sunday during the coming End-Time Crisis. 

    If Saturday were the True Biblical Lunar Solar Weekly Sabbath, [which it clearly isn’t], being systematically kept according to the Papal Antichrist System’s Counterfeit Gregorian Calendar], “Saturday” cannot possibly be that “True Biblical 7th day Sabbath” that Ellen G. White describes in her writings as the sign between God and His people because it is based on the Calendar Construct that Satan set up through his influencing of the Papal Leaders to do so. It is clearly NOT the 7th day Sabbath that Christ set up from Creation Week or at the time of the Exodus. That too, is an indisputable Biblical and historical fact!

    People may still choose to DENY this evidence, but it is obvious to me, that most people do not yet see or understand the whole picture in this controversy for I have raised issues about the Gregorian Calendar versus the Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar that are never raised by either Melody Clark, or by Shauna Manfredine or any other person who has written on this subject to my knowledge up to the present time. 

    These issues that I have raised in this document seriously brings into question the credibility of both of these Lunar Solar Calendar advocates because they are distorting the truth both historically and Biblically through a lack of thorough study of both in a vain attempt to militate against the Lord’s True Biblical Lunar Solar weekly 7th day Sabbaths so that they can continue to promote a week day belonging to a Calendar system that Satan had Papal Rome develop in Oct., 1582 that has put the whole Christian World, the Jewish World and the Muslim World in total disarray with regards to their present weekly day of worship. NONE of their weekly worship days constitute the Lord’s True weekly day of rest because they are set up on the Calendar that Satan had Papal Rome develop in Oct., 1582 and are being kept systematically every week, 52 weeks per year.



    Brief Historical Support for claims made in this study:

    Below are facsimiles representations of three Roman Calendar Artifacts dated between the years 84 B.C. to 81 A.D. referred to in this article, that all show that the Roman calendars in existence during the 1st Century B.C. and A.D. [B.C.E/C.E] both had a basic 7 day Core “Saturday to Friday” weekly cycle:

    The Roman Republican Fasti Antiates Calendar dated between the years 84 B.C. to 55 B.C. This calendar shows a basic 7 day “core” weekly cycle that is designated with the letters: A,B,C,D,E,F,G followed by the letter “H” – an 8th day representing “Market Day” when the people came to designated cities and towns to purchase their provisions for the following week and to sell their wares, etc.:




    The following Roman Calendar Artifact Facsimile is that of the Roman Sabine Calendar from central Italy dated between the years 19 B.C. to 4 A.D. It has a dual calendar construct on it: the Roman Julian 8 day Nundinal Civil Calendar brought in by Julius Caesar in 46 B.C. but not enforced until the following year, 45 B.C., along with the 7 day Planetary Week Astrological Calendar brought in sometime between 19 B.C. to 4 A.D. during the latter part of the reign of Augustus Caesar. You can clearly see that the ONLY difference between those two calendar constructs is the letter “H” representing the 8th day “Market Day.” Both Calendar constructs are seen to have the same basic core 7 day weekly cycle designated by the Roman letters: A,B,C,D,E,F,G that occur in the exact same sequence in both Calendar Constructs.


                                                                                                                                                                                              The third Roman Calendar Artifact Facsimile is that of the Roman Stick Calendar from the wall of one of the Baths constructed between 79 A.D. to 81 A.D. during the brief reign of Titus.

                                                                                                                                                                                              That, however, is “simply an illusion,” because a Papal Gregorian weekday construct that is a “Sunday to Saturday” weekday sequence has been used to produce the wrong layout the order of the Roman weekly 7 day Planetary weekly cycle for the month of April, A.D. 31 which NEVER had that type of week day sequence. 

                                                                                                                                                                                              When the TRUE Roman 1st Century 7 day Planetary “Saturday to Friday” weekday sequence is used as in Fig. 3 below you will not get a Wednesday/Thursday/ Friday sequence for the days of April 25, 25, 27 which represent the Abib/Nisan 14, 15, 16 three day Crucifixion Day to Resurrection day sequence, NOR will you ever get the Papal Friday/Saturday/Sunday sequence for the Crucifixion to Resurrection day scenario, either.

                                                                                                                                                                                              Here is what an unmodified 1st Century Roman 7 day Planetary Week Calendar month of April would have looked like in A.D. 31 if presented in an horizontal grid format where the days are presented as A,B,C,D,E,F,G, representing the order of the days of the week relative to the placement and order of the 7 Planetary gods worshiped by the pagan Romans as they appear in the Stick Calendar from the wall of a Bath constructed during the reign of Emperor Titus, which Roman Stick Calendar is dated between the years 79 - 81 A.D. The letters A,B,C,D,E,F,G represent the order of the days of the Roman weekly cycle in the 7 Day Planetary Week Calendar as corresponding in our English terms to “Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.”  This is based on the information contained in Robert Odom’s books.

                                                                                                                                                                                              The Papal System had to make people believe also that the 1st Century Christians, subsequent to Christ’s resurrection, were keeping “Sunday,” [which they alleged to have been the 1st day of the week] as the NEW “Christian” Sabbath of the alleged “New Law!” The problem with that line of reasoning also was that NO 1st Century B.C./A.D. [B.C.E./C.E.] Roman weekly cycle will support “Sunday” in the 1st day of the week position. Hence, the necessity to have a new Calendar Construct with a new “Sunday to Saturday” weekly cycle which would lend support to their False Calendar Propaganda. It is this new artificially contrives Papal Gregorian Calendar Construct with its new “Sunday to Saturday” weekday layout, coupled with their three levels of false propaganda claims concerning the Sabbath to Sunday issue that has the whole Christian world including all of the “Saturday” Sabbatarian Churches totally deceived about which day is the True weekly 7th day Sabbath and on Whose Calendar Construct it is to be demonstrated: God’s or Papal Rome’s Gregorian Calendar that is only 429 years old, only dating back to Oct., 1582 and no further.

Most 21st Century professing Christians of all faiths, being totally illiterate about the history of Roman Calendation from 753 B.C. to 1582 A.D. simply have accepted the 3 levels of Papal Propaganda as ABSOLUTE GOSPEL TRUTH! Because of their totally naïevté and gullibility, NONE of them are keeping the True Biblical Holy Days that are all listed in Lev. 23. They are ALL following false Religious/Feast Days, etc., set up by Papal Rome in their place and do not realize the difference.

Lickey, [who obviously believed that “Saturday” is the Sabbath and who, affirms that wherever you find the orthodox Jew, you find the 7th day Sabbath, Saturday], he is making three false assumptions concerning the Gregorian Calendar of Oct., 1582, namely that:

Lickey, by all of the 500+ “Saturday” Sabbatarian Groups and by Sunday keepers alike, that because the layout of the Sunday to Saturday sequence of the weekdays in what was left of that month after Papal Rome altered it,  everything is “business as usual” as if nothing at all significant had just transpired! 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             It is made to look that way alright, but when you see the rendition of what the October, 1582 calendar month would have looked like had the Papal System not altered it, recycling or restructuring the layout of all of the days subsequent to Thursday, Oct. 4, deleting days 6 to 14, making the calendar jump ahead 10 days in time so that the month of October now reads Fri., Oct. 15 instead of Fri.., Oct. 5, thus placing different days that appeared foremerly in different locations during the 4 2 weeks in the original unaltered monthly cycle for October, the shrewd, deceptive  Papal System then made a whole host of radical changes that most people overlook and play down as irrelevant because it appears to the surface reader that the Gregorian Roman weekly cycle underwent no changes at all! How many Christians in the 21st Century fail to see that the actually Papal Gregorian Calendar of Oct., 1582, though it is made to look as if has 31 days in, as if nothing at all happened, actually has only 21 days in it? 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             It is amazing that this has gone on undetected for the past 428 years. Nobody within Seventh-day Adventism has picked up on it during the past 167 years to my knowledge until I did last year when I took a closer look at what the Gregorian Calendar looked like in Oct., 1582 after the Catholic Church had taken out 10 days from former Julian Calendar month of October.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             So, based on the chart above that has the 1st day of the week of the month of October, 1582 beginning on Monday and NOT on Sunday, I am now going to reconstruct the calendar for October, 1582. Notice the difference that this makes:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Fig. 1: Notice where Sunday and Saturday occur in the unaltered calendar layout: Sunday occurs on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th days of the month, whereas Saturday occurs on the 6th, 13th, 20th, and 27th days of the month.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             What the month of October, 1582 would have looked like had it not been altered:

The altered calendar that they published and presented to the world in 1582, had only 3 weeks in it instead of the traditional 4 2 weeks that it normally had. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             2.     It was made to look like the weekly cycle was continued in its regular routine of “Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,” but different dates that were tied to different days in other weeks of that same former unaltered version of that calendar were made to take the place of the deleted days to give the “illusion” that “nothing had changed.” But something had radically changed! 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             3.    Even Sunday, Oct. 7, 14, 21 and 28 had also changed locations, disappearing from the Calendar in their traditional Sunday, 1st day position, being replaced by the dates of Oct. 17, 24, 31 where they had never been located before.  In that process, one Sunday was taken completely out of the October monthly cycle! 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             4.      The same is true for Saturday. Formerly, Saturday would have occurred on Oct. 6, 13, 20, 27 instead of occurring as Oct. 16, 23, 30 in the new altered Gregorian month of October, 1582. Thus one Saturday was completely taken out of the monthly cycle for Oct., 1582, and the other ones were moved around from where they should have been located.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             This means that technically, if the Roman  “Saturday” is TRULY the Biblical 7th day Sabbath, then there is 1 missing “alleged” weekly “Saturday” 7th day Sabbath in the Gregorian 1582 calendar for the month of October. This totally destroys the “Saturday” Sabbatarian thesis of an endless cycle of “alleged” 7th day “Saturday” Sabbaths [alleged by “Saturday Sabbatarians of all persuasions to have been transmitted in an unbroken, end-to-end chain of weeks from Creation Week], for 1 complete alleged weekly “Saturday” Sabbath based on that view is missing from the month of October in the Gregorian Calendar in 1582 on which the concept of a perpetual “Saturday” Sabbath from Creation to the present day is predicated.  

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             So, we not only have a total of between 6916 to  6968 “NON-EXISTENT” “Saturday” Sabbaths in the 7th day of the Roman weekly cycles where is it alleged to  have occurred during the 133-134 year span of the Roman Occupation of Palestine from 63 B.C. to 70 A.D., [which it can be proven  from historical sources that the Jews in both the 1st Century B.C./A.D. [B.C.E./C.E.] were clearly NOT KEEPING], as they could NOT POSSIBLY have been keeping a series of Roman “Saturday” Sabbaths in the 7th day position of any Roman weekly cycle known to NOT have existed in the 7th day timeslot in any Roman Calendar in the 1st Century B.C./A.D. [B.C.E./C.E.], seeing that during all of that time period, “Dies Saturnis” or what we call “Saturday,”  according to historical sources and Roman Calendar artifacts from those two centuries, Never Once existed in that position of the Roman weekly cycle. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Furthermore, as NO Jew was keeping a “Saturday” Sabbath during the 133-134 year Roman Occupation of Palestine from 63 B.C. to 70 A.D., and as NO Jew kept a 7th day “Saturday” Sabbath at any time during the 1st Century A.D., includ-ing during Crucifixion Week in A.D. 31, [because there was no such Roman week-day to keep in either of those two centuries], it is and should be obvious to all [who examine the historical/Biblical evidence with a candid open mind], that the Jews were keeping their own Biblical Lunar Solar Calendar which has no Roman “Saturday” in it, neither at the time of the Exodus, nor up to the destruction of the Temple in A.D. 70. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Therefore, it is quite obvious that the Papal Claim by the late James Cardinal Gibbons and other Catholics, [that SDAs and other “Saturday” Sabbatar-ians profusely quote as an alleged supportive authoritative Catholic documented support relative to the Catholic claim that the Bible enforces “Saturday” as the Biblical 7th day Sabbath is clearly” a Papal Propaganda Falsehood,” for the Bible enforces a Papal alleged “Saturday” Sabbath NOWHERE from Gen.1: 1 to Rev. 22: 21. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Hence, there is clearly NO such thing as a 7th day “Saturday” Sabbath that the “Saturday” Sabbatarians erroneously allege to have  gone all the way back to Creation Week especially seeing that of the 6916 to 6968 Roman weekly cycles that existed between the years 63 B.C. to A.D. 70, NOT ONE of them contained a “Saturday” in the 7th day position of any of those the 6916 to 6968 Roman weekly cycles during that time span making a total gap of 6916 to 6968 Missing or Non-Existent alleged 7th day “Saturday Sabbaths” during that 133 to 134 year period when the Roman occupied Palestine. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             So, as there were that many alleged weekly 7th day “Saturday” Sabbaths TOTALLY MISSING from the process of this alleged end-to-end cycle of weeks from Creation Week to the present time [with the alleged no breaks between the weeks or the months] during which break one had to look for the 1st Crescent/Sliver of the follow New Moon in order to be able to establish “New Moon Day” as Day 1 of the Biblical Lunar Solar Months [which no breaks between the months policy  that so many SDAs and other Protestant Papal Gregorian Calendar “Saturday” Sabbatarians are erroneously assuming to have been the case], it should be obvious, my brother, that there is NO SUCH THING as this perpetual end-to-end string of days/weeks/months that people allege goes from Creation Week to our present day, seeing that we have a missing 6916 to 6968 alleged “Saturday” Sabbaths in that process. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             There can NOT POSSIBLY be an endless string of “Saturday” Sabbaths from Creation Week to our present year 2011 when there were NONE for 6916 to 6968 weekly cycles from 63 B.C. to A.D. 70. You just can’t logically claim that there is an alleged endless string of “Saturday” Sabbaths from Creation Week to A.D. 63 when Pompey conquered Jerusalem, then a gap of 6916 to 6968 NON-EXISTENT “Saturday” Sabbaths [during 6916 to 6968 weekly cycles from 63 B.C. to A.D. 70, while the Romans had control over Palestine], which then, in some mysterious and unexplained manner, the thread of the weekly “Saturday” Sabbaths allegedly gets picked up again after August 10, A.D. 70 after the army of Titus destroys the city of Jerusalem and the Temple! That really would stretch logic and credibility to the maximum, and would be a definite “grasping after straws” in an attempt to prove by a senseless, false line of reasoning, the existence of a perpetual “Saturday” Sabbath all the way from Creation Week to our present day. There was NO Papal Gregorian 7th day “Saturday” from Creation Week and no continuation of the Papal “Saturday” from that time to our day because the 7th day “Saturday” that we all know in the Gregorian Calendar that we all use today, is ONLY found in the Papal Gregorian Calendar from Oct., 1582.

But it amazing what weird senseless, totally self-contradictory lines reasoning people will concoct in order to preserve an erroneous habitual practice that they have convinced themselves is TRUE!

Therefore, NONE of them could ever be the True Biblical Calendar because the True Biblical calendar is a Lunar Solar Calendar that has always had New Moon Day as a worship day as day 1 of all of its monthly cycles! By the same token, historical and archeological evidence during that same 1666-1667 year time span shows that NO Roman Calendar at that time had “Saturday” in the 7th day position of any of its weekly cycles!

This Papal Roman weekday construct is, therefore, only 429 years old as previously stated! Hence, it did not exist in the 1st Century A.D., nor at the time of the Exodus [which was 15 centuries prior to the 1st Century A.D.], nor at Creation Week which was more than 4000 years prior to the launching of the Papal Gregorian Calendar in Oct., 1582.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             That “assumption” [that ALL confirmed 21st Century “Saturday” Sabbat-arians have come to believe in], is purely based on the 7th day of the week position of “Saturday” in a Papal Roman Gregorian Calendar weekly cycle that clearly did not exist prior to Oct., 1582, which is only 429 years ago from our 21st Century point in time. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             This sheds a tremendous amount of “New Light” on this “Sabbath” to “Sunday” issue and the controversy surrounding it, which controversy is initiated mostly by those who have no true understanding of what took place during Cruci-fixion Week and on what days of which Roman weekly cycle in the month of April the Biblical dates of Nisan 14, 15, 16 actually corresponded to, and who have no idea what a 7 day or an 8 day Roman calendar looked like during the 1st Century B.C./A.D. [B.C.E./C.E.]! Almost everyone in the 21st Century is assuming that the Roman calendars in existence at that time looked exactly like what we see today in our Papal Gregorian Calendars. I believe that I have successively shown that that is clearly NOT the case!

It will also anger “Sunday Keepers” no doubt who will see the rug pulled out from under them concerning why they keep “Sunday” – a practice purely based on False Papal Propaganda Statements that has absolutely no Biblical or historical support related to anything that occurred during Crucifixion Week. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ALL of the “Saturday” Sabbatarians will also be “up in arms” because the Biblical and Historical facts shown in this document as clearly as I can present it at the moment, clearly indicates that there is NO SUCH THING as a perpetual “Saturday” Sabbath that can be traced back to either the 1st Century A.D., to the time of the Exodus some 15 centuries prior to the 1st Century C.E., or that can be traced back to Creation Week, seeing that the ONLY Roman Calendar to contain the “Sunday to Saturday” weekday sequence that we know today is the Papal Gregorian Calendar that can only be traced back to 1582 that is only 429 years old.
