# 6 months from 40

I am six months away from turning 40. I’ve been looking forward to 40 for 20 years.

My dad taught me a Time Frame that summarized life in decades. He said that my 20’s were preparatory years and my 30’s were initiating years. Those two decades got me ready to spend my 40’s and 50’s in the phase known as domination. I couldn't wait for domination!

One of the side effects of the Time Frame was that it helped me keep the majority of thoughts to myself because I believed many of my views were still in progress.

I still believe that life builds on experience but I’ve since abandoned the expectation of domination. (But that's for another post..)

One of the details of the bible that people tend to doubt is the ages of mankind at the beginning of time. Adam and friends lived well into 900 years old. People used to wait until they turned 100 to have children.

Accepting their ages makes me think that just because the body dies much younger doesn’t mean we attain wisdom much quicker.

So, even turning 40, I have an believe that in the grand scheme of things I’m just a toddler in time. My only desire turning 40 is that I can lead my sons in the ways of YHVH.

Here’s to Phase III.
