# finding a wife
I remember the moment I first laid eyes on Danae in the common area. She was alive and full of smiles. I was a senior at the time and had deduced from my parents story that college is where you find a wife. So, as I started looking for my wife, I found Danae.

We were friends for a semester and I looked for her wherever I could. Then, my grandfather funded a 2 month Eurpose back pack trip for me my brothers, and my cousin Jon. During that time, Danae and I emailed getting to know one another. Some of My highlights on teh trip were finding an internet cafe and seeing new mail from her.

I returned to Liberty that Fall and we started dating shortly after. I graduated that December, and she decided not to return to class. Since she was moving back to Florida, I felt the chance to work down in Flordia, 2 hours awy from her would be a nice way to continue our relationshiop.

ALl in all, it was a good time getting to know one another. And I had made up in my midn I was gong to marry her but I just hadn't proposed yet. SO, 6 months later, I approached her parents and asked if they'd give her permission to move back to Virgina so that we could be close to each other while we we were dating.

I came back to Lynchburg with a determination to solve my career puzzle so that I could take Danae as my wife. T-shirts were fun but not making me any income. I was working at a restaurant. So, I thought maybe I'll do the grandfamily business and go into insurance. I loved Danae and just wanted to provide for her.

So I went through the hoops to study for the life insurance exam and go through all itnerviews. I think I spoke with 4 different insurance companies; new york life, mass mutual, north western mutual, met life. I was in a position to work for any of them.

During this time, danae misread my intense desire to study as being aloof. She didn't realize that at 18, I was clueless and now the pressure of providing was right on top of me. I had to solve something immediately as I saw it.

I mishandled our relationship and understandably guys around her work were taking notice of her.That threw me for a loop and in the course of about 3 months of this, we ended up breaking up.

At my last interview, right before accepting an offer with north western mutual, I pulled back. I felt like I was doing that for her and if she wasn't in my life, then why subject myself to a career I wasn't into.

So, I went back to what I liked doing which was making t-shirts. I did that for about another month designing, printing, and selling shirts at a few local conferences. During that time I got contacted by a friend to go out and sell merchandise for the music bands. I was only waiting tables and the idea of going on tour was awesome.

So, I packed all my stuff up in VA, moved it to a storage unit in GA where my parents lived and set out to go on tour.

I was really distraught about Danae and myself. In total, we were not talking for about 6 weeks. At the time Pete Yorn's [music for the morning after] was out. I was listening to that album constantly. For whatever reason, that music made me think of my life without Danae. I didn't like that.

We were apart for 6 weeks before returning and I realized that the limbo was not a good place to be. So, I drove to FL and proposed to her. It blew her away that we were apart and then I was proposing. That was Spring of 2001.

It would be nearly 3 years before we were married. Once I had her as mine, I again started looking for ways to provide.

We both worked toward living in the same town again. My parents and her family were living in Ga so we decided to move there. It took us 9 months to realize that was not our home.

Although I was in pursuit of a career, I knew that marriage was more important. Since we could go anywhere, So, I thought what would be an amazing way to start our life with an 'extended honeymoon'. So, we moved to Del Mar and lived on the beach for that first year.

The majority of our time was long walks on the beach, eating thai food, and laying low.

I painted houses, did freelance graphic work, and t-shirts.
