Have all the difficult problems been solved in computer science?  
I’m typing through an indexOf() function in underscore and realizing that someone has already thought through this problem. I’m starting to wonder if my focus at this stage of my career is being able to;

Articulate the problem at hand that I’m tasked and trying to distill it into it’s common description. For example, instead of saying I run a t-shirt business called AMB3R, I am a middleman. Middleman is a universal business model that has nothing to do with t-shirts. The principals apply no matter what the concept is. 

I don’t think what I’m describing is knowing the design patterns, code smells, refactoring, and oo principals. I think I’m talking more in terms of managing data. It seems that CS is simply figuring out ways to find, filter, store, sort, and process large amounts of data. 

Is it possible to think of features in that way then turn around and articulate that in such a way that I can truly get notes about how others have solved a nearly identical problem? Hopefully once I can articulate the problem then I would be able to find the solution.
