writing maintenance
So far IAWriter is proving to do the job for me taking notes. I enjoy the clean interface, the ability to find notes wher I left off, and commit changes. I've enjoyed writing so much so that I've taken little time to stop and clean up some of my Drafts. 

I think I want to create some folders in drafts related to certain topics. Since, global find in IA Writer will find them. But why I like folders is the ability to create transcripts from smaller files. 

So I'm thinking of something like;

    drafts/
        topics/
            rails/
              _transcript.md
              methods.md
              etc.md              
            testing/
            self/

Anything inside draft that has an accumulation of small posts I can move into their own directory without feeling the need to have all posts on a single document. 

To name a few current topics of personal interest.
