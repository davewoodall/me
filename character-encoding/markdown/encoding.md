# encoding

I'm working on a bug ticket that has to do with encoding errors that are loosely related to RFC822 and RFC2047. Those two terms introduced me to IETF, which then in turn got me interested in TCP/IP, which then brought me back to the specifics of the RFC's, which is encoding. All of which is new territory for me. I think it's safe to say that any passionate web developer will find these subjects of interest since they are the foundation of our work. As such, I'm keeping some notes of what I'm learning;

## ASCII
## UTF-8
Unicode is a character set. UTF-8 is encoding.
