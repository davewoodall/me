## convenient faith
Another way to put it, is people tend to pick what is closest to their experiences. What is most convenient for them. I am no different. But who is in charge of experiences that we encounter in life? I'm not talking about goal setting but rather the aspects of life we cannot control. The year you were born. Your nationality. Your gender - although that is being under attack. Can I pick which year I was born? I digress.

My life's circumstances have been frought with challenges that are abnormal for the modern, american, male. That used to bother me because I didn't see that those setbacks and trials were answers to prayer. I had asked God to show me who He is. Little did I know that the people I trusted and the comforts of my life were interferring with the truth. 

So He removed my comforts and my circle of influencors to unplug my views and give me some new ones. I could have done what many people who have encountered bad situations and became so angry to declare myself an atheist. But I am not that gutsy.
