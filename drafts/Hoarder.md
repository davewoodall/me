# Hoarder.md

I'm an information hoarder. I am looking for the right answer to make my knowledge increase and my ignorance decrease. Evidence of this is my browser window. Nearly each day I fill the browser with tabs on so many subjects. I think this way because I am convinced that my problems are hidden behind a variety of videos, books, and blogs. In one way I need to accept that I will never consume all that I hoard. 

Lately I've been just posting it to twitter. Thinking I can save it there and show people what I want to learn. But the problem with that is Twitter is not easily searchable for my own needs. I need a better system. 

I want to be able to grab all this raw knowledge and some how store it for later. Then, when I need it, I can search my own records and see what assets I've already compiled on the subject

## Stop the bad part of new knowledge
Many times I look for new information because one of two reasons - either I'm not sure where I put my old stuff. Or, I am addicted to the hunt. I want to stop both of those habits. If I need something, I want to build on my previous search.
