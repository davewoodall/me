## 3rd Commandment

I've since come to love the 3rd commandment 

> Thou shalt not take the name of the YHVH thy God in vain: For YHVH will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain.' Exodus 20: 7.

Some people might thing a bell goes off anytime a bad word is said. But what I think the 3rd Commandment reveals is that YHVH is listening to every single word of every single person. No word is not unheard. The 3rd Commandment reveals the boundary line. 

It makes me want to watch my words all the more when I know that the 3rd Commandment is effectively saying "I'm recording everything you say and said of you."
