# HTML is the new English

HTML is so simple that people underestimate how you have to read it. You need to be able to read it differently than English. You don't just read every line. You look for keywords and attributes that are invisible, actions, visible, and placeholders.

HTML For
- content
- data
- actions
- structure
- style

So when you see a block of HTML, don't think 'oh man, I gotta read all this, it looks blurry'. No, you're going to only read the first little tag. something like `<li` and what you say to yourself is _Content_. If you see a tag that says `<button` then you say to yourself _Action_.

## Man Buns are everywhere.
I recently grew my hair out and have been wearing it in a man bun. I didn't do it as a fashion statement. What else do I do with long hair? After a recent visit to my grama while wearing my man bun, the next time I face timed with her she commented that now sees man buns everywhere. :-\
Where am I going with my style tip? The point is that once you are exposed to something then you will be able to see it more often. All HTML is not equal. Meaning, it all doesn't serve the same purpose and you do not read it with the same _left to right_ mentality you do reading English. But just like reading, you need to form a reason you are reading HTML. What are you looking for? Because there is a lot there.
