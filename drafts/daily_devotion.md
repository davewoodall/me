# spend your life in the bible.

Boys, 

Try to start each day with 15 - 30 minutes of prayer and reading of the Bible. As your father, I’m advising you to spend your life studying the  bible. It is a big book with so much depth and truth that even if you spend everyday for the rest of your life studying it, you will not reach the end. 

By consuming your time and thoughts with the bible your views of this world will be very different from the people who are not devoted. I’m not implying that you only study the bible and do nothing else. But what I am saying is to make studying the bible a daily aim. It will set your heart and prepare you for the day.
