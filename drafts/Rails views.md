Rails views

The JavaScript framework wars are something to behold. The question I have is what is the ultimate goal? Rails respect of javascript might not be as high as javascript developers want. But the point is not javascript. the point is communication. Communication is best when it's fast. fast is not only in rendering but also frequency of content. Simplicity has a positive effect on speed. 

Rails views are comprised of;
- erb
- partials
- ajax
- html
- css
- jquery
- dynamic attributes with `.erb`
- templates with partials
- caching with cache blocks


partials are instead of templates
erb instead of mustache
ruby instead of angular iterators
decorators for logic object organization
turbo links to manage 
cache blocks
