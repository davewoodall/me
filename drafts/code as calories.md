code as calories

Nearly every edible item you eat has calories. They taste different and have different value. Calories don't really tell us anything about the food itself. So we talk in terms of Fruit, Vegitable, Carb, Protein, oil, etc.

Let's use the calorie concept with code. Code is like a calorie. Code can be anything. So, we use terms to describe the purpose it is providing. Decorators, Models, Controllers, Views, Factories, etc. While the code is the building block, the concept is what is the value. 

So when you learn to code, you need to also know what you are coding. The level above variables, methods, classes, objects, and conditionals. What do those basic building blocks build. 

The code pyramid of knowledge might be
- language
- syntax
- code concepts
- code constructs
- business constructs
