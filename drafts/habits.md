## Habits
As a coder I am a knowledge worker. That means I not only have knowledge, I need to be able to get more, organize it, and reference the knowledge I have acquired. Knowledge is not synonomous with memory. But oftentimes repetition of knowledge becomes memorable. But many times knowledge is not attained at the same time you are using it. There have been only 2 or 3 times in my life that I acquired the knowledge at the same time I needed to apply it. 

Knowledge is what comes after processing information and experiences. Good knowledge is known as wisdom. 

Knowledge can increase with attention and focus. But how do we do that? The best way is to build personal habits that allow you to find, store, and review knowledge as needed. 

## Finding knowledge

Knowlege comes along overtly and covertly. Doing a specific google search helps. Many times though you might think **If I googled it once, I can google it again**. But it helps to document what the reason is you were googling that particular day. 

The other kinds are when knowledge comes to you. Via a friend, newsletter, or other form of alert. Your options are to ignore, turn to it, or save for later.

## save for later
So where do you save for later? As a knowledge worker this is beginning to get to the the point of this. 

## Closing the loop
When do you review the save for later?

## How do search?

The point is not the content but the context of what you are working on that the content presents itself. 

## Focus

The point is to articulate what you are doing and paying attention to the content that's worth saving. 

## Collect as you go along.
IA Writer has come in at a perfect time. It stays open (like now) to let me put down my thoughts into a well designed writer.  It lets me keep track of my goals;

**goals**
- learn TDD
- learn MVC

## what I like about my new system is;
- start with writing out my thoughts in my `/notes`
- then review what i did with git history
- figure out what's next
