# admin

There's two types of admin work. Admin for other people and Admin for yourself. 

Admin for other people is things like taxes, forms, compliance, meetings, etc. Things you do because someone is requesting it of you.

Admin for yourself is things like cleaning your bedroom, making your bed, or tidying up your files. It's not fun and nobody will tell you to do it. But it's best to keep things in order rather than let them pile up and become overwhelmed. Working on a laptop is easy not to truly see the mess that data can create.
