## middleman business
I used to say that I was in the t-shirt business for 17 years. But it’s becoming clear that the universal model that I studied and learned was how to be a middleman. How to use the power of two needs and make them find one another.

- find customers
- service them better, faster than non-middleman can
- establish lines of credit with vendors
- handle customer logistics and be the ‘big’ customer to the vendor as I scoop up smaller ones.
- get volume discounts from vendors and make my money from that spread
- get lines of credit to make purchases on behalf of customers.
- bill my customers accordingly

Do I know middleman business well enough to make middleman software? Is being a middleman someone who ducktapes their business together?
