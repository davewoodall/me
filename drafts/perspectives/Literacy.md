# Literacy

Code is a literacy. It is language for computers who oblige to your commands. I like that word, commands. I tell the computer what to do and it does it. Of course, I need to know what to say to the computer for it to obey me. That is what I’m learning. I’m learning how to talk _through_ a computer.
