Dear Oscar and Wells,
I want you to take a moment to stop. To let the flurry of your thoughts to leave your head. I want your full attention. I wish I could stare into your eyes and hold your cheecks while I am talking to you. But that is not what is reality right now. For many various reasons, the next best thing is for me to write these words to you. My absence is not a sign of my love for you.

I am your father and I love you.
