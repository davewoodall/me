I came into coding to scratch my own itch. I had built a custom t-shirt business that was duct taped together with spreadsheets and automation on top of the 37 signals suite. 

For better or worse, my drive to learn to code is still pegged to the problem I identified in 2010. I wanted to be able to create transactions that made my own work and my employees work faster. 

Which has me wondering if I have actually achieved the goal I set out to accomplish. Could I build an API on top of Basecamp that would allow me to use automate some of my tasks.
