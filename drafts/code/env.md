# The environment

I'm not talking about the hotly contested issue if man is so powerful to warm the earth. I'm talking about the issues I deal with in order to get to code. I'm at a point in my career where even my little personal sites are old enough to become out of date. I've noticed a simple `git clone x` > `bundle install` is breaking. What's up with that?

So now I'm at the place that I have personal motivation to know what's really going on in my mac environment. How does `brew` work? What's the real difference between `/bin`, `/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`. What does `rbenv` really do? Not to mention `rbenv rehash`. I also know that the actuall installation of rubys is managed in a plugin `ruby-build` but what does that actually mean?

So, I want to develop a better undersating of the environment in which I work.

Stay tuned...
