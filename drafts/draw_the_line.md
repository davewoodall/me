# Where to draw the line.

Have you seen the Jungle Book? It's really good and it's on netflix. There is a part where Mogli is roaming through the jungle with one purpose in mind when he is caught off while out of his element. Then along comes a snake who entices him then hypnotizes him before almost being eaten! That's what Single Page apps were to me. Nothing wrong with single page apps but those are for the node guys I'm a rails developer. I picked rails and it picked me. I am all for CRUD. The businesses I want can use crud. The technologies I want to work on only need crud. 
At least I see it that way. 

I thought I would take the time to explain this and share some resources that lead me to this conclusion.

# IDEAS
## Rails $50K
## DHH Rails is 10X and NODE is not 10X than Rails
## SPA's have flaws too
## Plus, Node is JS but there's a movement away from raw JS. 

Mike Vormwald yeah, they’re only $10 throuhg anyperks

[9:37 AM]  
the elixir/phoenix one and a nodejs one

[9:37 AM]  
might get a react too :open_mouth:

[9:37 AM]  
Dave Woodall did you join pluralsight via PM?

[9:38 AM]  
Mike Vormwald nah

[9:38 AM]  
Dave Woodall i watched a few pluralsights and they were really good!

[9:38 AM]  
Mike Vormwald hows that been?

[9:38 AM]  
i was a huge peepcasts fan

[9:38 AM]  
Dave Woodall It actually expired but oddly the codeschool still works

[9:39 AM]  
Mike Vormwald wait codeschool is pluralsight too?

[9:39 AM]  
Dave Woodall i’m torn on react / node. we have it so good with rails that i’m trying to figure out how much i want to learn outside that

[9:39 AM]  
Mike Vormwald that’s awesome they’re the best

[9:40 AM]  
totes… i’m teaching at this local code bootcamp

[9:40 AM]  
and they’re teaching MEAN stack

[9:40 AM]  
Dave Woodall yeah, codeschool is linked from inside and apparently the auth isn’t synced or somethign :slightly_smiling_face:

[9:40 AM]  
Mike Vormwald well, react instead of angular

[9:40 AM]  
so i’m trying to catch up

[9:40 AM]  
Dave Woodall oh that’s cool. yeah that would incentivize me to

[9:41 AM]  
M, mongo - right?

[9:41 AM]  
Mike Vormwald yeayea

[9:42 AM]  
Dave Woodall you put anytime into that?

[9:42 AM]  
is that a redis competitor?

[9:42 AM]  
Mike Vormwald yeah, but it’s way bigger

[9:42 AM]  
full document store

[9:42 AM]  
where redis is k/v pairs

[9:43 AM]  
it’s fast and cool, but generally not the right solution :0

[9:43 AM]  
so says the sarah mei http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/

[9:43 AM]  
Dave Woodall ha that’s what i gather

[9:43 AM]  
Mike Vormwald but whatever man, i’ll teach people how to use it

[9:45 AM]  
Dave Woodall I recently watched a DHH talk from 3 - 4 years ago explaining why Rails has been what it is. He said he felt that it was a 10X improvement from previous ways of doing things. and that when people saw it, they just knew

[9:45 AM]  
and whatever will take over rails will need to be a 10X improvement

[9:46 AM]  
that helped me keep my focus on getting good at the tools I use now

[9:47 AM]  
Mike Vormwald ah i like that

[9:47 AM]  
yeah, node sucks compared to rails

[9:47 AM]  
but it’s so much easier to teach newbs js

[9:47 AM]  
ruby is too hard to install

[9:48 AM]  
well first lets install brew, then rbenv, then… ok yup xcode-tools, install that

[9:48 AM]  
oh windows?

[9:48 AM]  
Dave Woodall yeah and that’s what keeps our rails jobs valuable b/c the code schools are switching strategies to node. (Same went for a few in CO)

[9:48 AM]  
Mike Vormwald :skype_drunk:

[9:49 AM]  
Dave Woodall i was both relieved and slightly bummed that the code schools in CO switched (to node) b/c they said it took too long to teach rails and that nobody was looking for those students bc they didn’t know enough (edited)

[9:50 AM]  
But i can attest as one going through that program… they’re right. It took me 4 years and honestly $50k +/- to learn (edited)

[9:51 AM]  
which is another reason I’m reluctant to jump ship :slightly_smiling_face:

[9:51 AM]  
My focus is drilling down on all things MVC related

[9:52 AM]  
Mike Vormwald tjat

[9:52 AM]  
hah

[9:52 AM]  
that’s interesting

[9:52 AM]  
you went through a rails bootcamp?

[9:53 AM]  
Dave Woodall yeah in 2012 - the original name / site / people are gone but here’s the one I attended:
https://web.archive.org/web/20120107123344/http://codeacademy.org/

[9:54 AM]  
I had a family to support so some of that  $50k was honestly living expenses while I was unemployed and just spending time self learning

[9:55 AM]  
I estimate that bootcamp gave me 600 hours of learning - but I think it took close to 1,000 before I had the the _beginnings_ of my bearings

[9:57 AM]  
the best thing was mostly emotional support. getting the ‘this is normal’ feeling was huge.

[9:59 AM]  
i went into it thinking that anytime i touched the terminal I was 2 steps away from `rm -rf /`

[10:00 AM]  
Mike Vormwald heh

[10:00 AM]  
nice yeah going through learning with a group is a huge advantage

[10:00 AM]  
as well as people who are there to unstick you

[10:02 AM]  
Dave Woodall yeah. after that it becomes pattern recognition that it’s all kinda the same in different situations

[10:02 AM]  
Mike Vormwald totally… students are amazed when i walk through and error message in node and connect it back to the code

[10:02 AM]  
gonna be fun when i actually know node :slightly_smiling_face:

[10:09 AM]  
Dave Woodall what i’m curious about is how Node / JS Frameworks will mature when the compilers start coming into maturity. Typescript as we know is a javascript that compiles to JS. Same with ES2105 and Babel. But Elm and Opal are non-js languages that compile. Did you see the birth and death of JS by Gary B? (edited)

[10:10 AM]  
Mike Vormwald yeah… those are interesting developments

[10:10 AM]  
i think elm/typescript are pretty awesoem

[10:10 AM]  
bc i hate js frameworks :slightly_smiling_face:

[10:10 AM]  
Dave Woodall “FOO compiles to JS for Node"

[10:11 AM]  
Future: ‘don’t write JS, write XXX which will compile to be node' (edited)

[10:11 AM]  
Mike Vormwald the surprising thing to me is how focused the node/express ecosystem are on single page apps

[10:11 AM]  
like there’s no prerendered HTML

[10:11 AM]  
well taht’s the anti-pattern

[10:11 AM]  
that caught me off guard

[10:11 AM]  
Dave Woodall that’s exactly right. did you see new Jungle Book (on netflix) it’s really good!

[10:11 AM]  
Mike Vormwald you just serve up your app page, and it’s all API end points

[10:12 AM]  
heh no

[10:12 AM]  
the live action one?

[10:12 AM]  
looked good

[10:12 AM]  
Dave Woodall connection - I was hypnotized away from CRUD to SPA’s thinking they were my future. Just like that damn snake does in the movie.

[10:12 AM]  
Mike Vormwald ah

[10:12 AM]  
Dave Woodall then, i read this ONE post and it snapped me out of it.

[10:12 AM]  
Mike Vormwald haha

[10:13 AM]  
i will push crud apps as far as they take me

[10:13 AM]  
everytime

[10:13 AM]  
maintaining 2 code bases is not fun

[10:13 AM]  
Dave Woodall and then proceeded to stop everything SPA related

[10:13 AM]  
Mike Vormwald what was the post?

[10:13 AM]  
Dave Woodall which brought me back to backbone of all places… :slightly_smiling_face:

[10:13 AM]  
standby..

[10:15 AM]  
funny thing is i probably would have lost it if I didn’t comment on it. I have to find it by going to my disqus profile (which I currently forget my login) haha

[10:15 AM]  
http://blog.trackets.com/2014/09/29/tips-for-building-a-single-page-application.html

[10:15 AM]  
made me realize that there is no silver bullet and that every tech stack will be fraught with challenges and bugs

[10:24 AM]  
Dave Woodall Really, I’m trying to figure out what is the most bang for buck and simplest solution for JS in a Rails app.

[10:24 AM]  
JS + JQuery + (underscore?) + (backbone?)

[10:25 AM]  
able to create compelling _concepts/components_ but not losing sight that it’s still primarily a rails/crud
