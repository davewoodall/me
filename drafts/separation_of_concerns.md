# Separations of concerns

One of the reasons I wanted to learn to code was because I didn't want to be computer illiterate. I wanted to speak for myself through a computer. Learning to code is completely invigorating. But you can also be paralyzed with what to do next. I know I'm guilty of not knowing what to do next and end up trying to do it all at once.

I think what will help me is to divide the responsibilities and have workflows identified for each of these specific aspects of communication.
