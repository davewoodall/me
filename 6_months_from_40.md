# 6 months from 40

I am six months away from turning 40. I’ve spent the better part of my previous 20 years looking forward to turning 40. My dad taught me a _Time Frame_ that explained life in decades. He said that my 20’s were preparatory years and my 30’s were initiating years. Those two decades got me ready to spend my 40’s and 50’s in the phase known as _domination_. The _Time Frame_ helped me keep the majority of my forming thoughts to myself because I felt many of my views were works in progress. I still believe that life builds on experience but I’ve since abandoned the expectation of domination. 

One of the areas of the bible people tend to doubt is the ages of mankind at the beginning of time. Adam and friends lived well into 900 years old. People used to wait until they turned 100 to have children. I happen to believe that to be true. But just because the body dies much younger doesn’t mean we attain wisdom quicker. So, even turning 40, I have an awareness that in the grand scheme of things I’m just a toddler in time. 

Here’s to Phase III.
