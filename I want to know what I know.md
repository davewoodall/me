## I want to know what I know

The second reason to share my thoughts is try to make sense of my own life. I have now have experiences that make my current thoughts disagree with previous ones. To put it another way, writing empowers me to read and review my own thoughts. To decide if what I’m thinking is clear and consistent. Writing allows me to disagree with my own thinking. Writing helps me articulate what I’m thinking. The things I think about are deep and wide. I need to document my progress as much for my own sake. In my quest for Truth, I want to explore the facets of the fringe. Some of those will unquestionably be the wrong direction.
