Rules give your children structure and thus well behavied children are a joy to be around. It perpetuates positive direction.

why just for raising boys.
I’ve only raised boys so I’m not sure how much of this bias will speak. While girls are also required to learn the same rules, I’m not sure how many of these are bent toward the male spirit.

not 70 rules
you might be thinking these are the 7 rules for the 5th commandment, so what are the rules for the other commandments? Well, the 5th commandment is for children to learn through their parents training them up in the way they should go.

At first it felt like this was kind of a soft commandment next to lying, steeling, murder, and adultry. But the reality is the Lord knows your in most parts. He knows that your earthly father is a direct reflection of how you view your heavenly father. If you cannot respect your earthly father then you will have trouble respecting, obeying , and trusting your heavenly father.

Obedience is our chance to discover that our parents and God are both to be trusted, regardless of our feelings. What might seem like a list of rules is really preparting your child to remain connected to His heavenly father.

i’m the boss
explain the tokens inside the i’m the boss
leadership, and ultimately employment. why employment? because we must learn to make money and provide. which is why you

I’m the boss because I pay the money. the boss is the one who is in control of your income and time. you do not disrespect your boss because you would be fired. There are consequences. Fortunately for children, their parents can’t fire them. But that doesn’t mean you are not the boss.

Parents like to excuse their children’s bad behavior that they are just kids. yet they reason with them as if they are peers. Treat your children like people, not peers. To drive this point further, what kind of performance review would your boss give you if you treated him (or her) the way you are treated by your children. Keep things simple and consistent.

List

before children confess the name of Jesus they are under the law. The 10 commandments. The 5th commandment says ‘honor thy father and mother’. if you do not use the word ‘honor’ much, then let’s back into it by taking the opposite approach as adults. Say you invited me over to your house for dinner. As soon as I walk in I make fun of your spouses outfit, declare that your taste in walk decore borderlines a gipsy, and your food smells as good as the pig farm I passed by. Assuming you are not yet dis honored, or disrepected, what if you asked me to leave due to my verbal words and I proceed to flip the dinner table and throw your silverware through the front window. By this time you should be threateing me with callign the police by which time I estimate it will take an hour for them to arrive. So I set my timer to 50 minutes and pull down my pants and crap on your favorite couch. Hopefuly by this time in the story you are tempted to burn this book because the very thought of these actions should envoke untold amounts of disrepect I have infliced on your house. The question is, how much of what I’m doing is permitted by the children under your care?

train up a child in the way they should go. when he is old he will not depart.
The time to teach your children to honor God to honor you is when they are children. if you wait until they are too old then you will live a life of children who dishonore you.

the way he should go.
What is the way they should go? to honor God. Studies show that our views of our heavenely father are simply words described of the relationship with our earthly father. so father’s job is to mirror as most what God desires of His children. And what does He first desire? Obedience.

Are you showing your children they way they should go is to obey God? If not, then let me explain the way to teach them to obey God. It’s by obeying you.

Treat your children like people, not like peers.

train up a child; 
how are you training them to obey God?

I live the same life you live. Bills, Job, Haste, hurry. So I came up with a few simple house rules that I do with them and i want all people to enforce them on my sons, no matter where they are. My rules are the same no matter who says them or where they are said.

- come the first time you are called
- your only response is ‘yes sir’
- i am the boss
- respect your brother
- no bad guys allowed.
- ask don’t tell
- beware of girls

Many people think that I am training slaves. To which my first response is, ‘yeah probably like the way Galations describes a slave’. But that is not my intention for their entire life. For the first 13 years I have a very short leash. But then for the remaining 5, we will reason based on the foundations that have been laid.

You have a choice. Either you discipline your child in love, or a strange will steel, kill, and destroy them without care of who they are. Because the world is wicked. Let me be loud and clear, you cannot trust anyone with your children who have not proven they are trust worthy. The way you can tell their heart is if you and your children discuss the laws were enforced and disucssed. No bad guys means that even relatives cannot be trusted until they prove they can.

I married a woman who had been molested and raped by her step grandfather from age four to eight. Her aunts and mother were also raped by the same man. Yet, the entire corrupted family tree never said anything about this. This is why I am adamant that you as your children’s guardian must guard them from everyone until you see reason to trust that those other people are not practicing wicked acts in darkness and secrecy.

no bad guys means you fill it with good things
games, wrestling, reading, building, working, chores

yes sir is simple
when you say something, make sure you receive a verbal response. any other word from their mouth when you tell them should invoke ‘yes sir’. no buts, no cuts, no coconuts. your words are power.

before you jump to conclusions, remember that commanrds are only one part of speech. You can also ask them things. But do not mix them. Ask their opinion and treat them like people. Which means do not reply with disprespectful tones, words, or patronizing them. Seek out their interests

children spell love “TIME”
you have to log many hours with your children. My parents didn’t so my view of God until I was in my mid-30’s was that He didn’t care either. Part of that was my experiences with my early father. But the other parts were that the enemy has so decieved me that I didn’t read the bible the right way.

honorable children are a joy to be with
chilren who serve and obey do not drive you crazy

the reason you might be sick of your children
There two reasons you might not be able to spend much time with your children. First, they are breaking God’s law and not honoring you. 
Second, you might simply be treating them like a peer and don’t realize you’re simply eating the icing on the cake, which is thin and taken in little doeses.

Your role as a parent requires more than you realize but the fruits of effort are that you receive children who are a blessing and not a curse. I am also aware of the excuse that your job prevents you from spending time with your children. Then we should probably admit your life choices demonstrate that your job are more of a priority than your children. And that’s your choice.

When you view your children as people and not peers then training your children includes;
- pray
- practice
- promoting
- playing
- preaching

Spoon feed your children
How long did you spoon feed your child? Just as you spoon feed their stomaches, you must also spoon feed their mind, hearts, and actions. The way you do this is to model the way. You should teach them and they will follow your leadership. This is how you can spend time with them and teach them in the ways they should go.

Foster collaboration
If you have more than one child you need to be aware they naturally compete for your time. Which means you need to spend intentional time with each child and share things directly with them.
You must also realize that unless you foster children to grow together, they will not naturally do that – unless they are sharing the same duress.

how to instill the rules
- display them for reference
- remind them
- have them memorize
- use role play of the good and bad side
- practice them before game day
- reward right and discipline wrong
- brag about their accomplishments
- identify other children who are not following the rules and explain what they would get if they were your children.

intro.
The first 7 years of life are the most formable in a child’s life. These are rules to set the direction for the rest of their lives. As a father, I needed to summarize rules in a way that was not an endless list but one they could remember as much as I could share it.

Spending as much time with the children means lots of conversation. As such, they want to talk, do, play, and challenge you.

You have two options – to respond without any consistency. Or you might have consistency but have not communicated it. Which is an unfortuante. I found that to declare the house rules and enforce them will go a long way to maintaining a growing relationship

benefits
- respect for authority
- lack of arguing
- treating loved ones with respect
- obedience as God commanded.
- protection and safety of your child

gifts are given, everything else is earned
tokens, work, and the real value of gifts when they are not constantly handed things.

practice toward reward, or discipline
it’s better to practice your training before it’s needed.

As a parent, you might feel that your plate is full. No doubt this is true. You have many hats and responsibilities for another life. In as such, those children should follow your lead. By practicing before you go out you ensure that when it’s public,

come the first time
Parents who have house rules are held to a higher order to not abuse their power. But as a parent who has all the responsibilities – you need your children to follow your lead. When you call your children, there should be no lapse between the time you call them and the time they respond. Explaining that and backing it with consequence will ensure they do not let slack. They must learn that all of their activities are secondary to your summoning them.

discipline
i spanked Oscar the most during his first 4 years. After that, I have not had to spank him. Because we had to explain these rules.

model the priorities
The only knees you will be held accountable to God for are your own. You cannot show make their knees bend to Jesus but if they see you bend your knees, then they will bend theirs.

Your first responsibility is to Jesus and if you’re married, second to your spouse. Then, your children. Often times in life it feels that is upside down. Before you can lead your children, your heart must be aligned with the Jesus.

i’m the boss
make it clear who’s in charge. Children do not realize the world they have been born into. You can permit them to rule the roost or show them that you are in charge.

guard your heart
a heart is the source of our life. If it is fed with wickedness, carelessness, or malace then it will sprout a life of that. Explain to children they must guard their heart from the wickedness the world seeks to influence on them.

Life is full of boundaries
better are the wounds from a loved one than to learn them in a careless and wicked world.

boundaries
Newborns need to be swadled because they are not able to control their limbs. This is the same as a child who needs to be cared for. They are looking for guidance.

By giving a child house rules, you are providing them context and security of when they are pleasing to you. For Children desire to please their parents is a natural thing.

Keeping things black and white gives children the confidence to know when to push and when to respect the boundaries.

people, not peers
Treating your children as people means to treat them with respect. However, many people seem to feel that this means to negotiate or discuss an idea with their children. But this is not the case.

yes sir/maam
people are surprised to hear that my children say ‘yes sir’. which shows respect to authority. it also keeps their lives very simple. They don’t come back with their views.

This doesn’t mean they don’t have a say. They have a say when you ask for their opinion. But when you tell them something. You are not asking for a discussion.

How much paganism is okay? (NO bad guys in the house)
it is not wise for runners to smoke. Nor is it wise to serve the One true God and bowing down to baal. As soon as you mix 1 piece of sin in the whole batch, then the whole batch ceases to be holy and becomes unholy. If you seek a holy house then consider which holidays you celebrate. If you raise your children to honor the LORD Jesus then consider removing all unlevan in your life.

- mind control television
- computer apps that are not worth giving them a token for ‘playing’
- pagan holidays

bad guys include;
- satan
- demons
- zombies
- vampires
- santa clause
- murdrous shows
- men of war who celebrate such violence
- ester
- darth vader

teach your children to build, not break down. draw a line in your house that it will remain pure for their sake. pray about the poisions you bring into your home. if you have trouble abstaining from poisions, consider what parts of your life are paganeious that drive you to cope and detach from other sins.
