## testing mentality
recognize there will be a lot of little things to maintain and fix while doing this full stack of coding. for example, the environment in which you start adding your content might be broken, confusing, or not setup to test as you know how. 

Know that to add a feature means to;
- understand the feature requested
- prepare the work environment
- add tests as needed
- make tests pass with code
- refactor code
- refactor environment which might include the surrounding tests, or factories, or gems, or directories, or files. make the place better than when you found it.
