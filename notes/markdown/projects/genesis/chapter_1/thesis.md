- Summary (heaven and earth)
- Description of the summary (void and darkness)
- Accomplishments of first day (light)
- View of the first day (good)

I believe in a literal 6 days of creation. Each day was 24 hours. But I wonder how much time transpires between the first verse and the completion of the first day. At first pass, it reads like a gigantic series of events. Yet, the conclusion of the first day ends with calling a separation of light and dark ‘good’. What about those other things that were supposedly created, _Heaven and earth_. Why are they not attributed to being created on the first day? And where do we find when water was created? We only learn of it’s gathering.
