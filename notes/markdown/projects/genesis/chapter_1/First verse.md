## First verse
My first clue that something is off is that Genesis 2:4 really should be Genesis 1:1. 

> These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that YAHUAH ELOHIYM made the earth and the heavens.

I did some quick googling and the rumor is someone wanted the text to start with the word _Beginning_. It sounds nice but as I dissect the text I am okay trying to put it back together in a way that makes sense. I've started a journey of reading the text for myself. So much so, I am not even bound by man's influence. These are Hebrew scriptures translated and sorted.
