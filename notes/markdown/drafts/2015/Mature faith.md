# Mature faith

## See God in every situation
Remember, we are daily crucified with Christ. The one who is crucified has no rights. Agreeing with this reality means we deny our vain attempts and accept His eternal will. For in acceptance, we confess with our lives that Jesus reigns supreme, even if we don't agree, or like it.
If the Lord's will for our life is waste, wonder, pain, or poverty then we say (in faith) that we want this too. For if it is happening, then it is Your permitted will, Oh Lord, and we know You are working it all for good.
Through these eyes of humility and faith we see God in every situation.

p.date Now if we are children, then we are heirs â€” heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory. I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. - Romans 8:17&18
