# Psalms
The Psalms take on a new flavor now that I'm paying attention to  prophecy. How now do I look at prophecy? 

I believe that the bible is written with many layers of meaning. Where some are real stories and others parables. They all speak of eternal concepts. The bible is not a book that will pass away. It speaks of eternal truth. That means that even the events that are prophesied about that may have happened are examples of greater truths. When there is victory that is already experienced then I think it is a symbol of the greatest victory to be experienced by all. It will be an eternal victory. 

So as I'm reading the prophets and now the psalms, I find a great comfort in the words of the warriors. And rather than wondering if it has already taken place, I believe that earth's greatest days are ahead of it. 

Israel is not just the Jews. Israel is comprised of 12 nations. Only one is known as of this day. But soon Israel will be gathered and I believe I am apart of that larger Israel through the sacrifice of Yeshua. So when I read of that people group in prophecy, I am not thinking their best days are behind me. And now I'm reading psalms with this new view.

It's my personal story of loss that has brought me to this place. So this is not a believe I gathered flippantly. In some ways I believe that my loss is what was needed to have my eyes be opened.
