# Chapter 31

## Laban catches up with Israel;

> 30  but why did you steal my gods?" 

### Matthew Poole's Commentary

> Laban could not be so senseless as to take those for true gods which could be stolen away; but he called them gods, because they were the means or representations whereby he worshipped his gods.

Is it possible that idols can be made to server a diety known as ourself? Is it possible that “You shall have no other gods before me” also includes us? If we are made in the image of God isn’t it possible that we might be tempted to think we are a god? And the way we serve the ‘me god’ is by making idols unto ourselves? Things that would enforce our views of ourselves… Just thinking here becuase as we see above Laban claims to have gods. But then 13 verses later he’s talking like a diety rather than someone who knows that all things come from a ‘higher power’…

> 43 Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. 

Sure, in some way he can act like those are his. Be we know he didn’t make a single sperm, egg, or ewe. What is he claiming that he was not really given?
