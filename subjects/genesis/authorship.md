Iâ€™ve started to notice that the book flows but is also choppy. I am curious how Genesis was written. I just did a brief google search under the theory that Genesis is a book compiled by Moses from a variety of sources. For example, Genesis 5 starts with;

> This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God.

I suspect Moses wrote it by compiling a variety of sources.
