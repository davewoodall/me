# chapter 32

> 28 Then he said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed."

Think about this. Those who would be called the chosen are those who would be apart of Israel. Those who would be apart of Israel would be those who strive with God and men. 

God is a great and rich mystery who tests, chastens, teaches, trains, leads, guides our journey. It is not by works but by faith in which we are saved. To strive means to 

> - make great efforts to achieve or obtain something.
> - struggle or fight vigorously.

Those who would be part of Godâ€™s children will be those who strive with God. 

Additionally, we will strive with man in so much as to defend our hearts from being led astray. For calling mankind to put off the delusion that this is the world worth living for. To call mankind to live for the world to come.

We are part of a gigantic story. An eternal story that simply begins on this side of eternity. This is the landing place. I like to think of it as the 2nd womb. Those who would truly wake up to the reality of reality would stop playing silly games and start living according to the truth that God, the maker of Heaven and Earth has created this moment of clay by which He is forming His bride out of the very dust of the earth. Those who would respond to His voice, His breath, will be filled with His life and spirit. The dust that does not respond will be swiped off the table and might as well be hell for the breath of God is no longer in you.
