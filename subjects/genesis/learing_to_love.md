# How I'm learning to love

Over the past week I listened to the entire book of Genesis four times in a row. Rather than music, I just played the ESV in the background. I'll confess that before starting to listen I assumed I knew the book pretty well. Boy, was I wrong. 

Listening to Genesis on repeat reminded me of rewatching my favorite Wes Anderson movies. I've seen [those movies] more than 50 times and still notice new nuances. The same experience happened while listening to all 50 chapters back to back to back to back.

After the second pass I started paying attention to the people. The characters got into my soul. I started imagining what I would do in the various situations. Stories include murder, lies, envy, failure, obedience, disobedience, defiance, war, bribes, deception, betrayal, rape, justice, faith, doubt, judgement, which unsurprisingly evoke intense thought and emotion. The book is a real life Princes Bride. 

After the fourth pass I realized Genesis has practical relevance for daily living. Any B+ Christian knows the [second highest commandment] is to love our neighbor as ourself. It's a statement that makes for a [perfect pithy poster](). But actually understanding how to follow that command is a bit challenging. The stories in Genesis prick the timeless parts of the soul. Which implies that If I felt relational laws being broken (or upheld) then so would my neighbor. Genesis plays a bigger role than simply recording the origins of the universe. Genesis helps people understand people. 

And that is my hope. That studying Genesis will show me what to do and not to do if I am to love my neighbor as much as I love myself.

Thanks for reading.
