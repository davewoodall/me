# Learning to love

The purpose of education is to improve the quality of living. Schools exist because people are naturally ignorant. The same holds true with people's understanding of character and love. How then can a person learn to love? Love is more than a feeling. Feelings are not always aligned with love.

If the second highest commandment is to love our neighbor as ourselves then it would make sense that we know when we are in fact following that command.
So, how do we learn to love?

First off, love is between people. As such, learning to love means understanding people. Second, love is complicated and requires more than pithy sayings with photos behind them. Love is a subject that must be studied if it is to impact another person.

So, where do I suggest we find such a guide? If you know me then you probably already know I'm going to say "The bible". But I'm not going to be that vague. Specifically, I believe we can learn to love from reading Genesis. The book is filled with sensational stories between nearly every relational situation. The attentive reader will be filled with intense thoughts and emotions while reading of life, murder, envy, failure, blessing, curse, love, hate, war, betrayal, anger, and more. (That summary reminds me of the opening of the Princess Bride).

As such, The text gives us a chance to be honest with ourselves by awakening our soul. Those thoughts and emotions are for more than entertainment. To those who would sincerely study love might consider extracting the many morals contained in each of the stories. There are underlying relational laws that are broken, upheld, and redeemed. All which teach us what to do and not do if we are to love our neighbor as much as we love ourself.
