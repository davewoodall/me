# How I'm learning to love

Over the past week I listened to the entire book of Genesis four times in a row. Rather than music, I just played the ESV in the background. I confess - before I started I assumed that I knew the book pretty well. Boy, was I wrong. Listening on repeat reminded me of rewatching my favorite Wes Anderson movies. I've seen [those movies] more than 50 times and still discover nuances I hadn't noticed. The same thing happened while listening to Genesis over and over. 

After listening the second time I started paying attention to the people. The characters got into my soul. I was in a position of comparing how I would be in their situation.  Listening to murders, lies, envy, failure, obedience, disobedience, defiance, war, bribes, deception, betrayal, rape, justice, faith, doubt, judgement, unsurprisingly evoked intense thought and emotion. The book is a real life Princes Bride. 

After my fourth pass I started seeing it as having practical relevance for daily living. Any B+ Christian knows that the [second highest commandment] is to love our neighbor as ourself. It's a statement that makes for a [perfect pithy poster](). But actually understanding how to follow that command is a bit challenging. I began to see that Genesis teaches how to love my neighbor.

The stories in Genesis prick the timeless parts of the soul. 
Which means if I felt it as relational laws were being broken (or upheld) then so would my neighbor. Think about this, for a moment; Genesis could be bigger than simply recording the origins of the universe. Genesis helps people understand people. 

My hope is that studying Genesis will teach by example of what to do and not to do if I am to love my neighbor as much as I love myself.

Thanks for reading.
