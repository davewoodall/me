      <h1 class='h1 headline'>Growth</h1>
      <p class='p'>Some of my favorite moments are when I realize that something that used to be difficult or time consuming is now easy to accomplish. This page is an example of what I'm talking about.

      <h2 class='h2 headline'>What to say</h2>
      <p class='p'>
        Some of my extremely talented coding buddies say  they don't blog because they don't know what to say. I'm actually the opposite. I have no lack of words or thoughts to say. My problem is I fear saying something in the wrong place and thereby losing it. But I'm starting to get over that fear. It's a fear that my words are important and worth saving. As an Introvert, I suppose I would say I feel like my words are valuable.
      </p>
      <p class='p'>However, I've started having different thoughts about the content I produce. Nothing I say will last. And much of what I say or write will never be read. Then, those of you who might come across this post fall into one of three camps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You don't care as much about what I think you do.</li>
        <li>You're not as vested in the words I say</li>
        <li>You're not even paying attention</li>
      </ul>
      <p class='p'>This is not an insult to you, dear reader. Rather, me voicing opposition to my own insecurities. The things that hinder me from being creative. Afterall, these thoughts are coming to me in this moment for some reason. (It's entierly possible that it's because I've had a glass of wine and it's 6:15pm.)</p>
      <p class='p'>But really, my point is, I love to code. And this rant is an example of why. Currently, I am able to voice whatever I want to the world without limitations.</p>
