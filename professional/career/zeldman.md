## Zeldman

Had a chance to listen to Jeffrey Zeldman at Event Apart. He discussed how things are in this day and age being not much different than when he started 20 years ago. Dealing with uncooperative browsers, differing screens, technoligies to standardize around. It's interesting to hear his point of view and maintain the same level of convictions for the standards. I wonder how how found such enduring principals.
