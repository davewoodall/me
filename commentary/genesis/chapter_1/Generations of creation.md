## Generations of creation

George Pember by way of Tim Alberino was the first one to point out the idea of a space between the first and second verse. That verse one 

> In the beginning ELOHIYM created את the heavens and את the earth.

is a complete story. But my point is not regurgitate their logic. Rather to add my own. Everything that is created by YHVH is good when it starts. Yet, verse two describes a barren and dark place. That is not good. And this picture of the RUACH ELOHIYM moving over the face of the waters. When were the waters created? We learn when they were gathered on the second day. Yet, verse one does not describe any waters being created. There are things that are missing to that story. However, it doesn’t seem _that_ story is the point of Genesis. Genesis 2:4 uses the term ‘generations’. It is possible that 1:1 was the first generation and verse 2 begins the history of the second generation of heavens and earth? If that seems too far fetched, consider that Yeshua describes a new heaven and earth which we are to encounter 

> For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind. (Is 65:17)

Would a new heaven and earth be considered another generation? I’m suspecting that will be at least the third generation of heaven and earth.
