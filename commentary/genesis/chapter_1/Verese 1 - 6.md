## Verese 1 - 6

> In the beginning, ELOHIYM created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the RUACH ELOHIYM was hovering over the face of the waters. And ELOHIYM said, "Let there be light," and there was light. And ELOHIYM saw that את the light was good. And ELOHIYM separated the light from the darkness. ELOHIYM called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day. (1 - 5)
