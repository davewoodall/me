## verse 3
The story seems to condense with verse three when we focus on specific creation at this point. Light. This light is not that of any particular origin, yet. It’s simply not darkness. What is that light? What is that darkness? At minimum they create the context in which the remaining activities are contained within. Day and night make a complete Day.

It seems that YHVH is in no rush. All events are built on top of previous decisions. YHVH has reasons for everything He does and everything makes sense. It all builds on top of each other. We’ll see it in the giving of the laws. Laws are proof that we are divine. We could not really have choice if there was nothing to choose. The problem was we didn’t realize we were at the top of the food chain. The prospect of death was so foreign to us we disregarded it. (But that’s for a different story)
