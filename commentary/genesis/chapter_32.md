# chapter 32

> 28 Then he said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed."

To strive means to 

> - make great efforts to achieve or obtain something.
> - struggle or fight vigorously.

The nation who God calls His are described as those who strive with Him. It seems then that salvation is not a matter of merit but of desire. To be part of Godâ€™s chose is to be apart of Israel would be those who strive with God and men. 

Additionally, we will strive with man in so much as to defend our hearts from being led astray. For calling mankind to put off the delusion that this is the world worth living for. To call mankind to live for the world to come.
   
## But what are we striving for?

We are part of an eternal story that simply begins with mortality. I refer to it as the 2nd womb. Those who would truly wake up to the reality of reality would stop playing silly games and start living according to the truth that God, the maker of Heaven and Earth has created this moment of clay by which He is forming His bride out of the very dust of the earth. Those who would respond to His voice, His breath, will be filled with His life and spirit. The dust that does not respond will be swiped off the table for the breath of God is no longer in them.
