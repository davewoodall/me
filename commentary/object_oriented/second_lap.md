# Second Lap

It's easy for me to think that I should be farther along by now. I mean the things I should be focusing on should not be this basic. But it's a strange thing that the things that used to confuse me at this second time don't confuse me anymore. But what that means is the books and videos I used to watch when I was confused... I now need to go back and re-watch and re-read now that I understand the material. 

In some way that can be depressing. To realize that I am not as far along as I thought. In another way, I think this is reality of learning some very complicated and broad topics. After all, I don't want to go into management or even launch a startup. My 100% devotion to code is starting to let up. Which means, when I am learning, I need to be learning the fundamentals. Those are the things that will endure. 

Examples?
Test Driven Development, JQuery, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, SQL, RegEx, Dev Tools, Object Oriented Design, HTTP, VIM

They might not be sexy but they are what I'm committed to. I want to _master_ these tools. I had the good fortune to attend [An Event Apart]() and to hear the Web guys tout their message in a roundabout brag that what they were saying 10 years ago still holds true. Semantic HTML. CSS for style. Content first. 

What prompted this is that I'm watching a Rails for Zombies code school and thinking to myself 'wow this makes sense' and 'I shouldn't be watching this. Shouldn't I be past this by now?' well the truth is, I'm not. I think the best way to compare it is when you had homework and didn't get the answer write even though the answer was in the middle of the paragraph you didn't read. Well, that's kind of how it feels now. It's not that I didn't read. It's just that I didn't understand what I was reading before. Now I do understand and I should rather be grateful that I now actually understand the material and enjoy the ride rather than be upset that I'm not farther down the endless road. I love what I do and I love learning. That should be enough to squelch the _bad feelings monster_.
