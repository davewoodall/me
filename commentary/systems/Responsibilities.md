## Responsibilities
- want
As a remote worker, my work is to write, read, code, and learn. To do _online_ well. I want to improve my skills of communication and craftsmanship. These are time consuming activities. These skills are endless roads. I want to live with that context in mind, rather than running an unsustainable pace because I feel that I can reach the end. 

	I want to make commitments to big topics. I recently cleaned out my backpack of all the code cruft I’ve been carrying for 4 years. It was really an invigorating experience to discover how much I know and how far I’ve come. It also gave me the confidence to focus and drill down on the advanced subjects

- tax
I want what I spend my time on to be known. That doesn’t necessarily mean market but simply be the opposite of hide my progress. That probably means a combination of publishing my content on a blog, ebook, or youtube. 

- stop
I want to stop the FOMO. I want to be okay ignoring the noise of new. I am grateful that the current skills I have are not going anywhere anytime soon. I want to stop distracting myself with subjects that take me from my commitments.
