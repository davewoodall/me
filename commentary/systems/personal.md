## personal
- work
As for me personally, I want to stop the bullshit. I call myself a Christian and I want to live as such. A Christian by the most basic definition is a term that is tightly coupled to the bible. You cannot be a Christian without reading the Christian’s playbook. I desire to know God through His word and do what He says, not what I want.

- tax
As far as personal chores, I want to keep my diet, exercise, and rest a daily part of my life. I’ve come to accept that I live a digital life. I’m on a laptop all day. I’m on my butt all day. I could easily let my body deteriorate. But that is not what I want. 

- play
I think play for me is just reading non-coding books. I’m reading [Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy]() and that’s fun.

- stop
I want to stop watching / reading / hearing about news. Again, it is not in my circle of influence and more so, I doubt that what we hear is even the truth.

- start
I want to get back to living by a routine. I’ve been sleeping in because I’ve been at a loss. But I’m beginning to see that there are _not enough hours in the day_ for what I want to do. Well, actually there are - I just need to wake up to have them.
