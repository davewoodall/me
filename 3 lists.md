# 3 lists
I'm starting to notice that my todo lists are falling into three categories. These are by no means universal, but for whatever we want to say, this seems to bring me clarity. Should do, must do, want to do.

## Must do are things I'm forced to do by others

## should do are things that I've heard about and I need to get better at. Be it knowledge, order, or preparation

## want to do. These are things I don't need much help doing. But I still want to keep track of them.
