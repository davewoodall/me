# regret

It is easy to regret my life's choices in such a way that i wish I could go back and do it over again. But why? Why do I want to go back and change certain decisions? 

Well, for example, I wish I learned computers earlier so that I could have started my career sooner. But again, why? So that I could be better, of course. But why? Well if I'm better, than I can be bigger, more successful, and more powerful. Oh. Well then in that case maybe I don't really realize what I'm _sad_ about. 

Think about thisâ€¦ do I really want to be more successful so I can be encountered with 20 years of challenges that I didn't have to face because my story was what it was. Does that make sense? In essence, I just wish that I could know things earlier so that my previous 20 years of life would have been _better_ up to this point. But stop and realize that I've made it. I'm here! I did not die all those times I thought I would starve to death because of my ignorance and isolation. 

What I should grateful for is that it took me 40 years to find something that I love so much I enjoy my time on earth applying it. But then, put this into perspective. My _global_ view of life, my spiritual world view, is that this world is just the second womb preparing me for eternity. What healthy person would argue the first womb was better than this world? Black ball of water that requires no sight, sound, taste, touch, love, or meaning. A matrix blob. 

I do not want to spend another second on this earth beyond what God has for me and He knows my paths and plans. I want to follow His will for me and I thank Him genuinely for placing me at this place and time. I look forward to Judgement Day when He and I discuss what I knew, where I failed, and where He brought me out of darkness and into His marvelous Light.
