# Begin with the end in mind.

My daughter passed away in 2014. My son, in 2016. I didn't go looking for death but death found me. Death changed me and this is a collection of those thoughts.

I was no longer satisfied by the church answer of end times solutions; Rapture, rewards, and golden streets. I needed something more tangible if I was going to survive.
