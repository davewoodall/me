# Verse 3

> And ELOHIYM blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it. Becaus in it He had rested from all His work which ELOHIYM created and made

## The sabbath is many things;
- a sign of the completion of creation
- an action we take to show devotion
- a stand against evolution, big bang, and round earth
- a believe that our produce is not a result of us
- work is not who we are, but an aspect
- rest is necessary
