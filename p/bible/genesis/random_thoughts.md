# Random thoughts

## Genesis Status
As I've mentioned a few times already, I'm camped out in Genesis. I think it started the first week of February of this year which puts me at about 70 days. I've probably listened close to 50 times by now.

## Validation about the text
As such, my mind has wandered into extraneous thoughts about the surrounding aspects of the text. Who actually wrote it. Why does it seem to have at least 3 different tones of voice? How much is lost in translation between Hebrew and English? Is the English accurately depicting what was written? 

As you might expect, I've encountered opinions across the spectrum of belief and denial. Some think Moses is a fictional character. Others say he is credited with authoring the book but  the work was done by others. But if the man spent 40 years in the desert, I'm pretty sure he would have time to write. Also think about the fact that he was accompanied by a million people who probably have some stories and documents they shared with Moses. For example, notice that Genesis 5 begins with "This is the book of generations". If Moses figured to write a book, why would he title a 'chapter' as a book. I describe all that to say, I'm doing as much research as I can to scratch the itch of validation of the source documents.

## People follow Laws regardless
But there is another dimension to the text that is less scientific. Have you noticed the types of people who accept these words as truth? The critics will say they are in bondage because of laws like forbidding bacon. Yet, our society has no problem forming diets made by man. Gluten free diet. Paleo Diet.  Organic diet. Notice the double standard? When man is credited as the source of authority, the world is okay. But when God is credited (and scientifically proven to be healthier) man resists. Something strikes a chord in mankind when the notion of a higher Authority is introduced. This is just one example of the double standard.

I hear people who reject the Torah, the belief that the Law of God is good and perfect and still in effect. They choose their own ways and laws. As far as I understand, the new covenant is one that is part and gives us who were far off, a chance to be reunited with YHVH through Yeshua. 

## World at war
Youth has a funny way of talking the most yet knowing the least. As I approach 40 in 82 days I am starting to see that I would rather reject the words of the world than go with the flow. I have lived long enough to realize that the world is at war with itself. People who live as they as the authority remind me of children who eat candy without a sense of realization of what they are doing to their body. 

## Heros
How do you pick heros? How do you pick role models? My criteria is someone who is or does something I admire. Something I want to imitate. Let's start with me. What do I want? I want to find the truth. I want to know YHVH as He desires to be known. I am looking for people who have the same pursuit. I find that those people do not simply attend church and then get excited about Monday's business meeting. (Like I used to). These people are actively, personally searching the scriptures and asking the difficult questions. Those people study the Torah with grace and humility. Steve (TorahFamily), Rob Skiba, and others who are regularly confessing their ignorance and the error of their ways. Those are men I admire and want to walk with.
