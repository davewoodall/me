# Authorship

I’ve started to notice that the book flows but is also choppy. I am curious how Genesis was written. I just did a brief google search under the theory that Genesis is a book compiled by Moses from a variety of sources. For example, Genesis 5 starts with;

> This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God.

I suspect Moses wrote it by compiling a variety of sources. 

The mystery of authorship is one excuse people use why they don’t read the bible. Still, no matter who wrote the book - it has the ability to impact my soul. These stories are more than entertaining.
