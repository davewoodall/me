# When was water created?

> The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters.
> Genesis 1:2 (NASB)


Ever notice that water just appeared in the second verse? Water is to important to be overlooked. I suspect it was created just like light was, except that it was created long ago.

To me, water is another example that the earth is older than 10,000 years and there is a gap between verses 1 and 2.
