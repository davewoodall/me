Genesis 1:1

# Before you begin

Depending on how you view life after death will greatly influence how you read this book. I've asked more than 10 people what they think happens when we die and so far, every answer falls into one of four narratives. Of course, you may be the first to tell me there's a 5 option of what happens when we die, but I am pretty sure it will be a variation of one of the 4.

## 4 ways to die

Nobody knows what happens when we die. We only say, think, or feel like we do. That leaves any grounded person to admit the they could be wrong, at least recognize there are other possibility. I have done that and here are my four options;

### 1. Crash Test Dummy

The crash test dummy view is that once you hit death, you're done. This is what atheists believe. There is nothing after death.

### 2. small gods

After spending 8 years in Colorado, I met many hippies, pot heads, new agers, and other types of white people who were convinced that we all become one with the universe. That we just float along. I asked them where they get their information and I am informed that 'they just know it'. They have no source of information other than what is inside their head, heart, or the plastic bag. What I hear them say is we each are making up what comes next. If 'making up' means it being real, then wouldn't that imply we are some form of diety? The Mormons believe that. That life after death is when we become gods.

### 3. biblical world view

Why is the bible the greatest selling book of all time? Why is it the foundation of every major religion? Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, Mormons, Jahova's Witness, Judiasm (The Old Testament). Is there something to it that has been choked out by mankind's systems, churches, and religion? What if the bible is telling the truth about what happens when we die? The bible says it is telling the truth. The bible says it knows what is going to happen. What if it is true?

### 4. non-biblical world view.

The biblical world view is responsible for terms such as 'sin', 'satan', 'heaven', 'hell', 'church', 'creation', 'commandments'. What religion exists that is completely different from the biblical narrative? What is the narrative? Does it net out as important that we adhere to it or just nice to know? For example, reincarnation is not a biblical idea and it expresses that we come back to earth as something other than human or we elevate. Right? So if I am human up to this point - either I'm about to go onto something new or just come back and redo life here. What is at stake?

## Why does this matter?

The first verse says "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."

That is easy to understand, but it is hard to accept unless you take it for what it says. I assure you, the rest of the bible will not be worth reading if you cannot take the very first verse as truth.
