# How I'm learning to love

Over the past week I listened to the book of Genesis four times in a row. I played it in the background instead of music. Before  I started I figured I knew the book pretty well. But boy, was I wrong. 

Listening to Genesis on repeat reminded me of rewatching Wes Anderson movies. I've seen [those movies]() more than 50 times and still notice new nuances. That experience happened while listening to 50 chapters back to back to back to back.

After the second listen I started paying attention to the characters. They got into my soul. I started imagining what I would do in their situation. The circumstances include murder, lies, envy, failure, obedience, disobedience, defiance, war, bribes, deception, betrayal, rape, justice, faith, doubt, judgement. The book is a real life [Princes Bride](). 

After the fourth listen I realized Genesis plays a bigger role than simply recording the origins of the universe. Genesis helps people understand people. The stories pricked my soul thousands of years later and I think it's because relational truths are timeless and universal. No one wants to be disrespected, dishonored, or discarded. The [second highest commandment]() is to love our neighbor as ourself. Genesis is filled with examples of how people love one another as well recording unloving acts that are just as effective in showing what not to do. 

My hope is that as I continue my study in Genesis I will become sensitive of what to do and not to do as I try to love my neighbor as much as I love myself.

Thanks for reading.
