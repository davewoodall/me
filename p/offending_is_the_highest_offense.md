# Offending is the highest offense

Political Correctness is saying things in such a way that they don't offend anyone. We can do anything we want as long as we don't offend. Offending is the highest offense. But what is wrong with offending someone? Is that the new law of the land? If women are allowed to choose what they do with their babies. Am I allowed to choose what comes out of my mouth?
