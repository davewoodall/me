# Skip church. Read the bible instead.

Do you go to church? Why do you go to church? Is church a central piece of your social or professional life? Does your priest, pastor, rabbi preach engaging content? Do you attend to offset non-church activities. Do you attend in hopes of finding answers.

The church is not the bible. The trend line for religious leaders is they eventually get too powerful and then become corrupt. If you want to have a relationship with God, then spend time with God.

The purpose of church is not to be entertained. Church is not supposed to be a Jesus flavored country club. If you're attending a country club then you're in the wrong building on the wrong day.
