# regret

_draft: April 20, 2017_

It is easy to regret my life's choices in such a way that I wish I could go back and do it over again. But why? Why do I want to go back and change certain decisions?

Well, for example, if I learned computers earlier then I could have started my career sooner and skipped all those seemingly poor years as a starving entrepreneur. But again, _why_? So that I could be farther along in life, of course. Why? Farther along means I would be bigger, more successful, and more powerful than I was and am now.

Oh... if that's what I regret, then maybe I don't really that I'm _'sad'_ about the wrong things.

Think about thisâ€¦ do I really want to go back in time so I can log 20 years of _different_ challenges that I didn't have to face because my story was not a rich and famous one?

Does that make sense? In essence, my current successes are making me wish that I could go back in time and try to survive on a different path. I need to stop and realize that I've made it. I'm here! I did not die all those times I thought I would have starve to death because of my ignorance and isolation. My last 20, really 40 years have made me who I am today.

What I should grateful for is that I actually found something I love doing! Granted, it took me 40 years and I can say, life is getting better with age.

Again, put my 'regret' into perspective. My _global_ view of life, my spiritual world view, is that this world is just the second womb preparing me for eternity.

I have made it this far and  and life is not about net worth.

What healthy person would argue the first womb was better than this world? Black ball of water that requires no sight, sound, taste, touch, love, or meaning. A matrix blob.

The good news is the bible generalizes life on earth for modern mankind as 70 - 80 years. It has been hard enough to survive this long, why on earth would I want to redo? If I am to regret anything, it's that I am only halfway done before I reach paradise.

Life has kicked my ass in such a way that I do not want to spend another second on this earth beyond what God has for me and He knows my paths and plans. I want to follow His will for me and I thank Him genuinely for placing me at this place and time. I look forward to Judgement Day when He and I discuss what I knew, where I failed, and where He brought me out of darkness and into His marvelous Light.
