# Royal blood
Ok, I'll come back to death later. Let me approach my point from another angle in story form. Say you me and a total stranger were at a party where I had a few beers. We're all laughing it up and all of the sudden, I get a craving for some chicken wings. Would you rather I drive your car, or the strangers to pick up wings?

$100 says you'd rather me drive the other guys car. Why? Because you don't own it. When something is not yours, you do not care about it.

Not only do you own a car, you own something else. You own royal blood. How do I know that? Does it bother you if you are cut in line. How about if I told you that your car had been taken for a joy ride and you had to pay for it? 

Royal blood expects to be taken care of. To be served. To be honored. To be respected at all times. 

Where did that blood come from?

You do not take offense to that what you do not own.

So, you die and you have royal blood. Let me pull those together.

What if you are in fact royalty. But not in the way you think?
What if this time on earth is for you to discover that You are both royal and even Divine, but not by your own volition.

Have you noticed that you cannot perfect the world in which you operate even though you tried?
