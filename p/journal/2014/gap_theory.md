I’ve read the bible from a very evangelical slant all my life. A very transactional view that just cuts to the chase. but this year i’m not really like that and i haven’t read the bible much either. I think maybe that’s opened me up to some other subjects in the bible, and ultimately about God, which could change my views about evangelism too. But that's not my point. I would say I'm finding a lot of interest in things about the universe that are not necessarily evangelical.

But some of these guys are talking about the world before Adam and i’m like, “yeah the first 5 days” but they talk like there was more before the 6 days of creation we know of.

listening to what I makes me feel like that my 'it all started with Adam' view neuters the realty that we know - that there is a supernatural universe with beings beyond our imagination around us. and we just block it out b/c we don’t currently interact with it. but these guys are highlighting the supernatural parts of the bible that are pretty awesome

topics of late include the world before adam, the world before the flood, giants, angels, demons, watchers, nephalim, and how the government is really controlled by satan
