## the battle of two men


It's like the difference between your baby teeth and your adult teeth. My 4 year old son chiped his tooth but in some ways we say that's 'okay' because he gets another tooth. It's as though that is happeneing in us. That Adam is our first life and is temporal for us to make mistakes. To get chippped. But soon those moments will be passed away and we will live with our new set of teeth.

I am of Adam, but I am not Adam. I am a decendent of him. The same follows that I am not Christ, but of Christ as a new man, a _new Adam._ This is where my new identity, as a man formed in Christ comes into play. I am neither a person with similar interests as my old self. Nor am I just absorbed into Christ and attached to Him. I am of him now and I have His nature. What all that means is that my desires, interests, and actions will be different as compared to my old self. I am becoming new, day by day. The opposite trend and direction as that of my old man. 

Nor is my old man the same as my physical body. Yes my physical body is dying but it is simply a temporary vessle, the womb in which my new man is being formed inside. For the old man was created with an auto pilot sense of control on my physical memebers, but his reign over this body is coming to an end. For, I am a completely new creation and that will be made known through my thoughts, feelings, actions, and words.

I am suggesting separating the thoughts of temporal physical body from adam's nature. Adam's nature will live in eternity with those who do not choose Christ to be their new life.

people attach adam with the body. Because, to a christian, adam is temporary. But in reality, the dead life of adam will live for eternity for those who do not choose Christ. Why i bring this up is that people think that our body belongs to adam. But the truth is it belongs to the life of whoever is stronger in you - adam life or christ life. if christ life is formed more in you, then you will find that it influences what you say, think, do, and feel to a larger extent to what adam's thoughts are. 

Adam wants his own glory, kingdom, wealth, and health. Whereas Christ wants to be second so that others might live. The life of Christ in you is not for selfish gain, but the gain and glory of the Father.
