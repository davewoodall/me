## The pursuit of success
Growing up in Orlando, I lived a life of freedom and fun. As the oldest of 11 relatives, I was king of the castle. I grew up with a view that life was meant to be fun all the time. As I grew up, I began to develop a sense of urgency that it was time to grow up, but I didnâ€™t know how. 

I didn't start reading on my own initiative until 21.

My efforts and attempts to live as the business and self-help books formed a personal kingdom I was determined to build. I experienced enough success that each time my house of cards fell, it was painful.

## it's not me, it's you
Childhood formed me in ways that my old nature would later respond to with urgency and anxiety. Through those pursuits I encountered many setbacks and failures that confused me. 

I was looking for people I could partner with to make a name for ourselves. To do something big.
