## Sitcoms and candles
I’m looking at wealth and success as old childhood sitcoms I used to watch. Like a fondness for Voltron I can think of those things with a sense of fondness. But I have outgrown them all. I now see that their allure was something that was misguided and vain.

I think of my relationship with God during that time and it feels like someone who would walk into a cathedral and light a candle so to appease God that I was there. I did it in sincerity but with the misguided desire. Without realizing it, I was praying to God to bless my pursuits of my goals. My kingdom. 

Sure, what I wanted was noble in my eyes. But the plan still ended with me on top. I would be king of my kingdom.

But the Lord has done an amazing thing for me to come to that realization. 

## Confidence in the Lord
The sense that the Lord is my confidence is evidence that things are changing. God promised to meet my needs and direct my steps. But He never said He would get me on top of the corporate ladder. What I want is so conflicted with the Lord that I end up choosing to believe that God is missing rather than I am misguided. Is that pride, youth or both? 


## 
I’ve been thinking a lot about my relationship with my mom. I don’t know many details about her relationship with her dad. Just that it was a rough one. I only heard her tell one story of her childhood shortly after she was meeting with a counselor. I was probably 19 at the time. She was telling me how when she was a child her and her sister were on her way home from school and she was singing a song about how her dad was going to spank her when she got home but she didn’t have any idea the reason. 

My mom married my dad when she was 24 and he was 21. They had all four of us by the time my dad was 25. I was the first born. I refer to my first 12 years of life as the Peter Pan years. We lived in Orlando, Florida in a neighborhood that was well insulated from traffic. So, we had free range of the streets, bushes, and surrounding woods. 

We would play baseball and war around the block and all kinds of games. There were probably 50 other kids in the neighborhood that were around my age. It was not uncommon to bike over to David Franz’s house to plan nintendo. Play Legos with Kevin Lear. Play some G-rated version of Dungeons and Dragons at Steve Taylor’s house. Read Comic books at Tom O’briens. Play GI Joe’s At Armands House. Play baseball with the Mammon kids. Smoke cigarettes with with David Heart. And all sorts of other types of activities. 

I also watched my share of tv. I probably watched every episode of Bewitched, f-troop, Gomer Pile, Andy Griffith, 321-contact, reading rainbow, price is right, and more. Then, when I was tired of those, I could always play some nintendo.

I spent so much time playing and could do whatever I wanted. Everything was within biking distance. The super market. The hobby store. The library. The baseball field. The YMCA. We would ride bikes to spring lake and spend hours there. Just me and a friend, cousin, brother, or combination of them all. 

When I think back on that I have a few thoughts. First, I boast about how times were different and that we were safe to do those kinds of things. I can agree to that. But, I can also say that by the time I was in 5th grade, I was staying the night at the Bishop’s house who were probably 8 homeschooled kids. During the sleep over, the kid my age asked me if I wanted to see something  and he opened a bottom dresser drawer and showed me his older brothers copy of playboy. I had never seen anything like that. It didn’t catch me at first because the the angle of the magazine was more in his favor. I never really thought to tell my parents about it. Then, I remember being allowed to spend the night with the Shelton’s when I was in 6th grade. If my memory serves me correctly, Eric’s father was an ex convict who was somehow allowed to have custody of his 3 kids. 


## Parents & grandparents
My parents didn’t seem to mind to let me spend the night with them. He didn’t seem to mind us watching R rated movies. They had HBO and whatever else and we would just stay up all through the night as unsupervised 6th graders and watch whatever came on. 

My grandfather was in the insurance business. He was the top salesman over 30,000 agents of Met life. He was able to retire around his 40th birthday. He got saved and became an evangelist like you wouldn’t believe. I still have his script down 20 years later.

“Tell me Tom, if A bomb were to drop here in the next 5 minutes and we were all killed, do you know where you’d spend eternity?
If I could tell you, would you like to know?”

I couldn’t have a friend in the same room for more than 5 minutes without Grampa asking my friend that question. It got to be so embarrassing and predictable, I wouldn’t bring friends over if my grandparents were over.

My dad was a preacher as early as I could remember. My grandfather had so many ‘intense’ views on theology and doctrine that he and my dad would argue about it constantly.

When I start going back to my childhood to think about my own memories and relationship with my parents when I was a child, that is the first thing that comes up. “Your father and Grampa were always fighting”

That answer was sufficient for a while. 

I don’t know what they were doing but it wasn’t raising me. My sister had once said it that they were ‘for us, they just weren’t with us.’ 


## Love
The point of this is not to beat up on my parents. But I needed to see how I formed some valuable views of the most important trait. Love.

When I think about how my parents love me, I see how my mom would seriously do anything for me. She was Wonder Woman. 
I started to see that my mom loved through doing and my dad was MIA. My mom served us all so well. Food, clothes, errands. She worked as a graphic designer and would take us with her.

If we are made in the Image of God. And God is Love. Then I had a need to experience love. My definition of love up until my 37th birthday was synonymous with my definition of service. Doing stuff. You showed me that you loved me by doing things. You showed me that you loved me by letting me do things for you. I showed you love by doing thing for you. I showed you love by accepting those things you did for me. If you didn’t do things or let me do things for you, then I began to question why we were together. A very legalistic way to live life.

## My career
My career was a misguided stumble into entrepreneurship. If you look at my [linkedin](linkedin.com) you’ll see that ‘entrepreneur’ is my top endorsed trait. That wasn’t something I necessarily set out to do. It’s something I stumbled into when I had no real idea what a job looked like. I punted on jobs throughout high school and college. When I graduated college I had the bright idea of trying to grow a skate team. I was living in a dream world. What should really be voted up there is ‘aimless’
I had no clue what to do so I tried a lot of things. My confusion made me frantic because I was trying to make money by playing, not working. My parents were not around to help sharpen me to explain that what I was trying was not an economically sustainable lifestyle.

The entrepreneur trait in me eventualy matured into a genuine desire to build something that would earn me recognition. Something that would prove I had value when I sat on top of it. 

I started a christian t-shirt company in college that I had mixed motives for doing so. In once sense, I felt it would be a cool way to do a good thing while making money. But it was just a really expensive outlet to design my own t-shirts. I didn’t have a clue about how to make it a company. Which resulted in it failing after 10 years of on and off pursuit with it.

Getting stung by going out of business because I wasn’t managing the finances was not going to stop me from success. So, I started taking accounting classes at a local community college to learn from my mistakes. I took four classes over a two year period before I sat down with my accounting teacher and asked when do we talk about projections and making sure we are planning properly. He told me I was in the wrong field. That what I was referring to was finance, not accounting. Okay…

We were living in Nashville at the time. Nashville was not good to us. I had worked for a company where the boss had admitted to me on a few different occasions that he was intimidated by me. So, when I came up with a new idea to and he ended up stealing it. 

During this time, the real estate markets were booming so I thought maybe I should get into real estate since t-shirts weren’t working out. I looked into real estate programs and ultimately found one in Denver. I had loved Colorado for 10 years and when the thought of using grad school as the responsible reason to move West, I moved forward with it. I was accepted to DU as a dual-degree program of real estate development and MBA. 

Before I had begun classes, Danae and I were at the library and she randomly found a book on the shelf that described nearly the exact vision of what I had thought I was going to school for. So, I picked it up and read [new harvest]() excited to get some prep. What shocked me was that I had realized that industry was not for me in the slightest. 

I called my admissions counselor and explained the situation. He said that I could switch no problem and that the way the dual degree worked, I could delay any other decisions about the MBA stuff. I ended up switching out of the Real Estate and enrolled in the Masters of Finance program. 

I was 31 years old when I enrolled in the program. I was on the older side. The kids I was around made me think that I had not yet found my audience. After talking with Danae, I started to think that an MBA is only worth something if it’s from a top 5 school. So, I ended up unenrolling from the MBA side and just focused on the Finance. 




## bigger story at play
but there is a deeper underlying story at play. One that can easily be lost in the eye of the overly rational man. Just as nature can be a winning argument for both evolution and creation, I believe my circumstances can be argued for and against God. But I see that there are larger reasons that a Loving and caring God would allow me to experience these things. 

## my heart had to be prepared
I wasn’t ready to hear the larger story until I had lost complete faith in my own story. It took continual setback, a lost child, a grieving wife, lost company, failed goals, debts, homelessness and unemployment before I stopped and had a chance to ask myself what is going on.

my heart heart had to be both revealed and prepared to handle the truth. That I was born of royal blood. But that blood is not something I earned. As a human being, we are all born in God’s image. God is royalty and we are His children. As children, we own what it feels like. I am of Royal bloom, but not how I initially thought.

I needed this family. These experiences. This season of extended wandering. The setbacks. The debts. The losses. To soften my heart. In the midst of that, I was applying my God-given glory to serve myself. That’s the same thing that Lucefier did. In this safe place called Earth, I am allowed to give life a shot without surrender to God. I can live like I am God. I can try my hardest to achieve the things that I think will satisfy me; respect, honor, praise, glory, and worship. I want that BMW because I want you to look at it and admire it and the driver of it. I want to think about you thinking about me. That when I drive in, I know what you’re thinking about. Wondering how to be like me. Because i have value, I have worth. I have what you don’t have. and if I own what yo don’t have you want to be like me. 

Lucifer was kicked out of heaven for thinking those things. I get to experience having them and seeing the result of those feelings. The leave me with envy, anxiety, competition, and all the things opposite of God. Because I don’t get what I want. What I want is my will. My will depends on my own Health and Wealth. I realized that it a key way to determine who’s will I’m living unto.

While I was swimming one morning and I could feel something was not right with my shoulder. I started to wonder how would I exercise if I couldn’t swim. Then, the Lord spoke to me and said what if you were to live in sickness and poverty. Do you think that would impede my will? I realized in that moment that my will was depended on my health and wealth.

Does God need me, my health, or wealth to accomplish what he wants? Do I say I want God’s will or mine? Then, how do I feel the moment I get an unexpected bill in the mail? How do I feel about myself when I get injured or catch a cold. I fret that I won’t be able to complete what I need to. Would a God who knows all really put you in that situation?

That’s when I started to realize that my confidence in the Lord was so low because I couldn’t trust him to come through on my goals. How can I have confidence in a God who won’t show up? Well, it turns out - He’s not interested in helping me accomplish my will. But as I begin to relinquish my own will, I see how an unintended result is my confidence in the Lord is going back up. To the point of almost physical logistics.
