Outline
=======

I. The Goal
Common sense to christians is that we Love God and People while
keeping it up that I like doing that.

The Law is in our hearts and that is not faith. I cor 2 explains
something that we would need the faith for.

The gospel (purpose of earth)

God's glory (a brief note why God isn't insecure)

II. A framework
- Intro w/ examples of what dispensation is
- Overview of the 7 Dispensations
- Grace and pauls role in our current dispensation

III. Law vs. Grace
The goal of the law - to bring us to the end of our selves

why you can't live in both law and grace - `pushing vs pulling' and
the natural man wants merit. little merit is merit

The law is important, but only as imporatant to bring you to the
reality of new life. once you can ride a bike, you no longer need
training wheels.

Grace and Spiritual meat require faith to put into action. You can see
why no other viewpoint than "God is in control" will keep your sanity
when walking in the Spirit.

IV. Living in grace and faith
- Rom 6:1b "That grace may abound."
- No condemnation - Love remains from beginning to end of the journey.
The agenda is not more bible or works.
- Grace vs. victory
- Consider your high expectaions

V. Misc
- A note about witnessing - Agenda's dont work
- Faith requires humility and listening.
- No two people will be alike when the Spirit is responsible for your
formation.
- The journey on earth is a spiritual gestation
