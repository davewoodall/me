# mike

My brother mike and I haven't gotten along. I suspect there was something to do with how were raised. 

But i realized that I was really selfish as Adam 1. I was selfish to get the fame, fortune, attention, and influence. I'm not sure how that began. Again, mabye how I was raised but i wanted it all for myself.

My brother mike was trying to compete with me. Trying to take what was mine. And in doing so, we rivavaled for friends, attendtion, love and affectino. 

As I began to lose my life this summer, I began to ask some questions during my troubles with my wife. We were apart for 5 weeks and I had time to think back on some things. As I started to think of my past, I found myself with the capacity to think about michael. I began to see him in a new light that maybe he was as lost as I was and we were both searching inappropriatly for things.

I'm out in CA for a conference and I got to spend a day with him yesterday. During my time I began to see that my selfishness fostered a challenging relationship with mike - as mike was competing against me and my views of building my own kingdom.

But what i realized that the side effect of stopping to build a kingdom is that you have the ability to look unto the Kingdom that God is building. Also, that in accepting God's kingdom, the root of my selfishness was dying. I was no longer selfish, so I was able to see mike in views and ways I had never seen before.

Which helped me begin to see evidence of the changes that take place when Christ is my life. When He is my life, I can see things that I couldn't see when my kingdom was my life. 

By stopping my kingdom, I have stopped feeding my selfishness, which has changed and fostered love for people I couldn't love.

It's helped me see that the forming of Christ is a process of losing myself.

The next thing I began to see is that in my weakness, I am able to see God move. When I am not attempting to drive, I am forced to rest. In my rest I see Him move me to highs and with me through lows. That I need these things to learn about both God and myself. 

Only after going through several deaths have I began to give up on myself. In those moments, it's as if I was on a water tube being tugged along. I realize movement of life when the rope is tense. My tube doesn't move by my pathetic attempts to paddle it forward.

I can rest.

Seeing God on his terms means positioning myself in a posture that he explains is opposite what it takes to build my kingdom. Death, servanthood, setback. In all these things and experiences, Christ is able to show Himself alive and well.

Take 30 days to stop pursuing your kingdom and asking Christ to lead you for 30days. Watch how He shows up and see how many times you can walk in peace and trust through good and bad times.
