# New man outline

This section is about the change and realization that a fetus has been formed in me known as the new man. The new man is a part of me who is identified with Christ and who He as called me to be. 

## SECTIONS
### Accepting Christ means new life is birthed in you.
### Observations of what itâ€™s like to have a new life formed in me
### The Spirit sounds like your voice (and basement talk?)
### Adam is not my body, so Christ can influence it too.

- the old man wants health and wealth and his will
- the new man is not formed for a while.
- the new man is your unique self formed from Christ. 
- the notion of of an angel and devil on your shoulders
- the old man is angry with my past 
- the new man sees it is what I needed to come to the end of temporal behavior, where as now I look at money and dreams of this world like childhood sitcoms
- the old man will not stop enticing me until the day I die, so I want to begin to defund his resources of time, money, and body.
- let the new man have the way with the physical resources.
