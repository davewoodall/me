Glory

Don't we admire people who exhibit tenacity, determination, resolve, and sacrifice? I suppose people could say those glories were a result of the Big Bang looking favorably on those people who possess diligence. But I like to believe they are gifts from God and reflections of Him that produce whatever man uses them for. He starts it and we participate with him.
