I didn't go to boyscouts as a kid, I went to awana. This was christian boyscouts without any of the survival stuff. We also had to memeorize bible verses to win candy and prizes. At 6 years old the leader gave the closing talk about hell. He said it was a lake of fire and pain and if you didn't want to go there, you needed to accept Jesus as your savior. No problem here. So, at 6 years old, I repented of all my sins and gave my life to Christ. 

I have no idea how much a prayer or motives like that got me into heaven. I just never really feared if I would go to hell though. I suppose that was step one.

My grandfather preached at the homeless mission in Orlando. Me and my cousins would go with him becuase we would go for a Wendy's frosty and fries afterward. I can't say I was really interested in the lost. At the end of the time though Grampa would give the sinners prayer and I think I prayed that 20 times. That was just to make sure God heard me.
