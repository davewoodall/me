# Rough Draft

### Overview
Tweets, posts, likes, and links. The amount of noise in our daily worlds is common routine. We all know the social spheres are shallow. So where is the depth? What does life look like when activity and success are gone?

For those looking for deeper meaning and truth will find it in unexpected places. Places we are not interested in finding answers. What if the painful places of life have value in that they force us to define true meaning and substance for ourselves?

What if life’s mysteries are part of God’s plan for much larger purposes than we could imagine? Including discovering who you are, how you were made, and how to find the peace and acceptance in life’s hardest times. 

### Part 1: The plot thickens, Peter Pan.

Growing up in Orlando, I lived a life of freedom and fun. As the oldest of 11 relatives, I was king of the castle. I grew up with a view that life was meant to be fun all the time. As I grew up, I began to develop a sense of urgency that it was time to grow up, but I didn’t know how. 

My efforts and attempts to live as the business and self-help books formed a personal kingdom I was determined to build. I experienced enough success that each time my house of cards fell, it was painful.

The natural man avoids pain like a cat avoiding water. Nobody wants pain. But what is God doing when things die. that is surrendered to God? Only after my old nature failed enough times did I lose confidence in him and his efforts. I was ready to listen and discover a new way to live.

### Part 2: Living Like Lucifer

Made in God’s image means we are of royal DNA. God’s glory is a power that must be held with care. Lucifer was made just above the treeline of ‘safe’ glory and he couldn’t handle it. 

I discovered that how I wanted to live was how I was made but my initial attempts were misguided. I was taking the glory and applying it to building my own kingdom, which is a false sense of reality.

### Part 3:You don’t need eyes

In the womb of your mother you could have survived without any trouble if you were blind, deaf, and mute. Those attributes of you were not necessary in the world as you knew it. It was not until you entered a second reality did you come to appreciate spending 9 months being formed.

All of creation models the patten and ultimate story. That we were not made to be apart from God. That this world in it’s fallen state is a perfect picture of the stages each person needs to experience to be prepared for our eternal position. It seems to take, generally, 70 years or so for us to be ready for our second birth.

### Part 4: In the matrix

We begin this life on earth with an eternal life that is focused on health and wealth. Self-centered and self-seeking. That life needs to be exchanged for a new life which comes from Christ. As Christ breaths life into you, your New life is formed and developed in a womb of your earthly body. 

As you grow you will begin to understand your internal design of body, soul, and spirit. The Spirit was dead with Adam but made alive in Christ. When you come alive in Christ, you will begin to hear His voice in you leading you to a different way to live.

At this point, you are influenced by the Spirit who made your unique body and soul
