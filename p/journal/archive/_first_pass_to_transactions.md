# The first pass

I started to learn to code the way I picked up learning excel. It was something that would help me build my business. So, I set out to market my t-shirt company with html and css. But, how do you create transactions.

I came across rails through basecamp. As I started to learn, my path went through Starter League

## basic computer computer programming
Picture yourself just dropped off in the middle of a foreign country that speaks a language different than you know. Let's use French. If you were dropped off in in the middle of Paris, what would you do to get around?
You don't know how to ask for coffee, or find the bathroom, or other basic conceps. 

Or think of it in another way. How difficult is it for people who don't know English in America. They can get along, but by and large we know their economic and social experiences are significantly limited.

In Human languages, we have verbs, adverbs, nouns, and adjectives.
In code, we don't have those. We have functions, variables, arguments, loops, and data structures.

Like learning any new language, it is uncomfortable at first to read and right. But soon, you will become comfortable because you have an amazing mind.

The official term is computer programming. You need to understand what a computer needs, and why. 
- loops
- arrays / hashes
- conditionals
- functions
- variables
- arguments


### Language Syntax
All languages use nearly the same concepts mentioned above. but each one implements those concepts a little different. You will learn about dynamic vs. statically typed languages. You will also learn about languages that lean toward funcational programming vs. object oriented programming. 

My focus over the past 6 years has been;
- html / haml / slim
- css / scss
- javascript  / coffeescript
- ruby 

## Frameworks, Libraries, and API's
The amazign thing is once you learn to read and write, you learn that many developers that have come before you have written many different useful programs that you can freely use.

### Frameworks
A framework is a collection of code that serves a specific path and manages the common, utility aspects of the task. 
For example, Wordpress is great for bloggings.
Rails is great for transactional websites
Angular is for managing javascript

## the environment
When I first learned about frameworks, I was pretty clueless as to how the world worked with them. It is very helpful to understand how things work with and around your code

### client
The client is the frontend, the browser, or what is consumed. There are other ways to to consume, but this is the layer that is used.

#### cookies
Cookies are how a browser or site can 
#### localstorage

### http
you have seen http, but you may have never noticed it. HTTP is the way that things ship over the intenet. It's not the only way, but the way of the web.

### server
Servers are the side that manage the heavy lifting of the web app. Hosting includes Heroku.

### databases
Databases are the component that stores the data. 

## organizing code
There are good and bad ways to write code. If you plan to write code for a company, then you need to understand some basic principals of code organization.
You don't need to know how to have it down, but you need to be aware that not all code is created equal.

Here is a list of things that I have studied that have helped. I won't go into them, but I will mention a few resources how I learn(ing) them.
- dependency injection ()
- design patterns ()
- OOP (POODR)
- solid (clean code)
- dry

## tools
Like all craftsman, you will have tools to do your job. These are the tools I have found to be crucial;
### text editor
Text editors are what you'll spend your day in.

### curl
As you learn about HTTP, you will learn about headers. CURL is a tool to use in the terminal to check headers. 

### terminal
The terminal is the finder.

### chrome extensions
- cookies
- 
### dev tools
### pry

## testing

## setup
