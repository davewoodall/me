# unpopular

Peter Theil has gained recent popularity when he supported Trump. I knew of him from his collection of essays he compiled in his book 'Zero to One'. One of the essays he wrote asked what is the most unpopular opinion you hold. I really liked that way of describing a sense of thinking for oneself. 
As I approach 40 I see that I not only have unpopular ideas, I am an unpopular person. I refuse to accept the world in which I am born into. I reject nearly every main idea that the world has presented about our origins, current situation, and what to live toward.
