## battle tested faith
Do you want your beliefs to hold up in good times or in both good and bad times? If you want your faith to transcend your experiences; if you want your faith to be larger than yourself, then you must believe in something that is unmovable. 

Faith is not synonymous with pain free living. Faith must endure the trials of life. People naturally should pick the solution that comes easiest for them when trying to solve a problem. So, when life is easy or when we are told certain things, there is no reason not to believe the people we trust. But what if the people we trust turn out to be wrong? Or what if the things we believe only work in certain situations - the good times.
