Just for context, I grew up in the church, my dad currently works at northpoint.org. I went to Liberty and studied the doctrine of non-denominational churches. The technical term of the doctrine is called Dispensationalism. Dispensationalism essentially says - the church is the new game plan for God and creates this second line of identity and doctrine for a non-israel based group of people and says the church will be handled differently than Israel. That view splits apart the bible and puts emphasis on the new testament and keeps us shallow at grace without awakening to what we've been saved to.

So, after roughly 20 years of that view I now see that's false doctrine. It sliced apart the bible and made me think the OT was obsolete or at minimum irrelevant to me. It also gave me the view that I had a certain level of unhindered freedom because I was saved by grace. I'm not talking about obeying the law as a means to get to heaven (legalism or catholicism or anything) but rather a new view that the Law is the black and white nature of who God is and what He wants from us. The Law does a remarkable job at revealing the posture of my heart and having enough authority to make me change as a person.

As such, I have come to see that real story is that (as Romans 11 describes) we the church are really part of Israel after all. Not Jewish (Jews are only 1 of 12 tribes). We are part of the big story and it's one big story. Not two.

All out of Psalm 119;

Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I keep your word. (67)

It was good for me to be afflicted so that I might learn your decrees. (71)

The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces. (72)

I know, O Lord, that your rules are righteous, and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me. (75)

Let your mercy come to me, that I may live; for your law is my delight. (77)

If your law had not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction. (92)

I will never forget your precepts, for by them you have given me life. (93)

Oh how I love your law! It is my meditation all the day. (97)

Trouble and distress have come upon me, but your commands give me delight. (143)

Look on my affliction and deliver me, for I do not forget your law. (153)

The sum of your word is truth, and every one of your righteous rules endures forever. (160)

I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek your servant, for I do not forget your commandments. (176)

Christ set us free from the _curse_ of the law by paying the penalty. But that didn't not delete the law or the clarity the law brings to the soul. The pivot is that the law is alive and well. (Read 1 John 2 - 5) The sobering thing is that there is a standard and the question is does our heart choose God's way by choice? In grace, we now have a choice to obey Him. People say they obey God but what if obedience is counter cultural? What if obeying God, according to the Law, is opposite the ways of the world? Would we still choose to obey Him? For example, the Law shares some actual changes to adhere to. Abstaining from unclean foods, resting on the Sabbath (the 6th day, Saturday), obeying God's 7 feasts (not pagan holidays like Christmas and Easter).

I'll admit my heart used to think the Law and these things were no longer necessary. But upon deeper study of the NEW testament, I see I was reading it wrong - with eyes that let me live how I wanted to live rather than in submission to the Word of God.
