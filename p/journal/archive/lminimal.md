# What if this is your title
[] this is a todolist
- not bad
## Journal
how to end 

## opps you need a line between each section.

Rules-
'sections start with # and end with a line break. example:

# my journal            <- this is a title that starts with a hash
i love cats & dogs.
dogs are cool.
cats are two
                                <- see that is a line break
# toDo list                <- great, no do big things..
