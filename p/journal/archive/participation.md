## 10. People want to do more than watch paid staff do the fun stuff.
People want to talk, participate, use their brains, serve, mentor, listen, confess, pray, sing, commune, be advised, ask questions, give answers, collaborate, contribute, celebrate, and invite.
Church should be organized so that participation means more than parking cars and handing out bullitens. Another example: When people are in the true spirit of worship, they don't need professional singers to lead them. If worship is pure, people's eyes are off the worship team. Let any and all who want to praise, praise. This doesn't mean that everyone is the leader. It means there is no need to worry that bad performances are going to remove the attendees.
