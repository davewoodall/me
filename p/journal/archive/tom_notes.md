1. use a pr to update the gem and ensure that works.
anytime the ground has changed below - make sure that works before working.

while this is in production, then start working on my ticket and know that I might hear back from other devs 

2. then, use a 2nd pr to build my ticket.

3. find a rake task with `namespace :people` in search

## TODO
