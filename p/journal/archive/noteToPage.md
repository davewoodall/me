At the risk of sounding like a moderator, may I propose 2 points of view before I make my comment...
1. Let's recognize that we're talking age old debates here and that these comments should be considered points of view along the journey. It's looking like we're trying to convert someone here!
2.
Try to look at it from a progression instead of one single snapshot.

From my perspective, the bible teaches that the one who lacks maturity should be under the law (10 commandments, Gospels, church, bible, etc.)
But the one who has discovered a higher law - The LIFE of Christ dwelling inside - can thereby begin to live by listening to the voice inside.
This is the life of a mature believer.
Gal 4 tries to explain this that we are under the law until the time we're ready to live as our true destiny.
At that point - Recognition of eternal destiny - I agree we can start to have a little more freedom to 'question' which laws are for the young and which are
