Eldar is a genuineuly

- smart
- helpful
- teacher
- savvy
- pap

- I am fortunate to know Eldar in professional context.
- His knowledge of JavaScript and Engineering in general has helped me to greatly improve my understanding of difficult subjects that I were new to me before joining LivingSocial.
- Specifically, Eldar's grasp of JavaScript down to the nuances enable him to describe the aresas I was uncertain.
- For example, last year he provided me the same questions he asks in interview, the debouce function.
- After I tried my hand at that, we walk through the areas of difficulty together.
- There have been 3 or 4 instances of Eldar helping there.


I met Eldar through forming the Angular club in 2014. In Spring, 2015 I started on CSR which uses BackboneJS opposed to Angular. As interest in the Angular club died down, I asked Eldar if we could continue meeting about BackboneJS and more specific JS.  He helped me ramp up much quicker on BackboneJS than I expected and he also helped me understand some core JS concepts that I hadn't learned. I appreciate his willingness to be patient and help me learn the larger context. LivingSocial is fortunate to have him and I'm glad it worked out for us to be on the same team!
