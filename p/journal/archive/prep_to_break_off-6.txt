Prep to break off
=================

Orders were screwed up.
These accounts are my book of business
I have spent 8 years working with these clients.
I lost orders on passion, north point, and bigstuf
On top of that they’re finding other supplers
Passion – for world tour
NP – for drive tee
Bigstuf – jedidiah

I’ve stuck through:
1. Overseas problems – Pyknic
2. Applique problems – Wharf tee
3. Oversize problems – pyknic
4. Losing business – passion, bigstuf, NP
5. Late orders –
6. Expensive orders – trying to sell ‘we do more than screen print’…
but we don’t.
7. The Dec sales 30K drop… I don’t like that 30k can disappear and no
one knows where or how to explain.

I’m not interested in working with people who have no industry
experience
Scott, Josh, brooks, brian…

In my haste to improve futura’s production I went to LA, but that
doesnt’ seem to be working.
I found another supplier who will service applique, threading, and
some belt work.
They have low minimums and fast turnaround on applque

I would like to deal with them directly with the big 3.

I want to deal with them directly so i can offer lower prices and keep
them happy.
All other biz i’ll work straight through futura.

thoughts?

PT brian & Josh aren’t cutting it for me…

They can only handle a few projects

Subsidizes while I’m building this
