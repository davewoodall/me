One of the attributes of a [tortoise](I consider myself a tortoise) is I can think about a lot of things at the same time. And I can think about them for a long time. I'm still thinking of [CLOV3R.com](). 

I also like to switch things up. I'm noticing that I haven't written in a while. Part of the reason is I've been in Missoula for the past month. The other reason is I've been coding this site rather than writing content for it. But that's the whole point, constantly updating your own repo. Even this will be added to a repo. 

I was reminded of how many ideas I have strictly by looking at my `git status`. I have so many floating idea. 

The interesting thing is I'm about to have the time to actually pursue these ideas. I've been steady plodding on, litterally, too many to count.
