# outgrowing Rails

Today was the first day that I realized that, as a Rails Developer, the best thing for me to do is outgrow Rails. Not to leave Rails, but in order to write better Rails code. Companies (i.e. businesses that hire) do not want me to build a Rails app. They want me to make their business run with software. That software has some secret sauce. Some business logic that is _not_ rails. It turns out, Rails is just the delivery mechanism for their business solution to reach their users. 

This is not a knock on Rails. This is an awareness that my value amongst Ruby / Rails developers is cutting through the boilerplate and knowing how to continuously deliver business value. As Uncle Bob said, ‘Rails is a detail’. ‘The database is a detail.’ This makes me want to start inside a gem and make my business logic work. Then, simply plug it into the delivery mechanism, Rails.
