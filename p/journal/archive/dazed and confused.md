# dazed and confused
In the Summer between 9th & 10th grade my parents decided to move us to Northern Virginia. Dad had a bible school friend he was going to work with. I remember mom and dad sitting us down and selling us on all the 'pros' of going. The failed to provide the 'cons' list of leaving a place we loved. I hadn't put much thought into it because I didn't realize the finality of moving.

Life in Orlando was fun, sun, and friends.  To put into perspective.  my Florida high school was across the street from Universal Studios. The 4,000 student school was immaculate and perfect. Some of the members from N'SYNC and backstreet boys were in my classes. The highschool baseball team was AAA and players like [Johnny Dammon]  went to school there.

That was my definition of normal.

The high school I attended in Virgina was built in a cornfield, in 1964. The years growing up in Northern Virginia were so confusing for me. My Orlando childhood was replaced by cornfields and steve miller band.

I was told the youth group would be my new circle. Great, a built in social network. I looked forward to everyone loving me as much as I was loving them. Turns out that wasn't the case. The circles were already tightly formed and I was on the outer wall. The one silver lining is that's where I met Josh Woodyard. He became me guide into art, music, and general youthful mischief.

Cornfield high was a AA baseball team. While I didn't even make second day of tryouts in Florida, I incredibly made the team in Virgina. That was an unexpected victory. I confess I didn't take it as serious as the other guys on the team. They played their hearts out like we were one level removed from the majors. Call it the contrast or some internal apathay I don't know but I didn't exert the kind of energy they did. So, those guys didn't become my 'circle'.

Since Youth Group or sports didn't take for me, I ended up in the party crowd. There it was what I was familiar with. Unproductive fun. But this time we had weed and liquor. It feels like aroudn this time I can look back on two active emotions. I was completely depressed that I no longer lived in Florida. And, I had a strong desire to make a name for myself.

The party crowd has a low bar for success. You just need to contribute something to the crew that makes the time more fun. It can be a car, the weed, the party spot, or humor. I think I wanted to offer all those things. I found myself doing what I could like normal to out do the crew.

I got into trouble and did so because it seemed to help me test the boundaries. I wasn't sure what I could get away with and I had come to the consclusion that my inner limit was imaginiative. So, I started pushing the boundaries. I ended up getting into trouble with the law that at 17, I had almost enough to be sent to Juvinile detention until I was 21.

Looking back on those years, it seems that the only times my parents and I had conversation would be either about logistics, or repremanding me for my bad behavior. I don't recall any attempts to provide a platform for me to walk onto that would get me out of that tailspin.

I barely graduated highschool. My "Where they'll be in 10 years " was "In Jail."
