mike, 

can you retrace some steps for me because we were on a path then the trail went cold and I am asking with a very neutral and open ended way, rather than assuming from a position of spite. I am really excited to see what is happening with Mike's Island Dip but I am unsure some of the timing and I wonder if you'd be willing to share your perspectives.

You might recall, I was hot on this new Boulder Restaurant called Lyfe because it was cheap, good, healthy, and modern. But you might recall, they were initially very interested in Bika Brew and so I shared that information with you. I shared some information with you about that because you had expressed an excitement for opening a large, commercial kitchen and do something exciting in the food space. 

I smiled at your chat when you said "Wow.  I didn’t realize both of my brother’s were experts in getting food products to market.  I should have ask from your advice sooner!" and it wouldn't be hard to interpret that as a passive agressive comment.However, you might recall that I worked at Meriwether's through college and both Steve and I worked as waiter's when I came up with BinkaBrew when we were nestled together in Alpharetta. But I digress.

Those prefacing comments are to provide some perspective that my writing this is not an off the cuff letter but an effort to begin new habits and relationships with you.
