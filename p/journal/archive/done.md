# Done.

It took me longer than normal, but I'm done with the preparatory part of life. The part where I am consuming. Not producing.
This part is applying what I've been given.

Feels like I took longer but then again, it gave me more fuel. More desire. More drive to do what's right. Here I am.

Ready to initiate.
