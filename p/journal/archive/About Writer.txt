## Changes to iCloud Integration in 1.7

Writer has changed how it interacts with iCloud to comply with Apple’s iCloud recommendations. You can change whether Writer uses iCloud in the “iA Writer” panel of Apple’s Settings.app:

- If you change “Use iCloud” to ON, iCloud stores all your Writer documents and makes them available on all your devices. Any Writer documents stored on this device will be safely moved to iCloud. Any Writer documents already in iCloud will become available on this device.
- If you change “Use iCloud” to OFF, Writer documents are stored on this device only. Your Writer documents in iCloud will remain untouched, but you will not be able to access them on this device, without changing the setting ON again.

## File support

Writer uses plain text files, such as .txt and .md (but not .doc or .docx), in “UTF-8” encoding.

## Writer For Mac

A Mac OS X version is available too. Look for “iA Writer” in the Mac App Store.
