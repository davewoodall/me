AMB3R 30 days in
================

Lots has happened so far.
Looks like we're going to have about $60k in sales our first month! A
huge amount of that is the 17,000 piece white tee, which is about 30k
itself.

I went down to AZ for 2 days to meet with Jeremy and meet with Steve.
Things are looking good so far with him. We have yet to do any
applique, but we're optimistic.

I got the LLC papers back. I couldn't believe it when I saw they said
"ABM3R" I spelled it wrong! Not a huge deal, just annoying.

While I am excited, I am still holding this one loosely. I really want
it to work, but I'm really making sure that I don't overly commit as I
am in school.

I am optimistic that Jeremy can handle the work production flow and
we'll get it taken care of.
