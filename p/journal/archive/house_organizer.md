# Seven steps to organizing a house.
It takes at least a year to begin to settle into a new house. You have more, or less room that your previos place. Your initial thoughts of room use, storage, and lifestyle are best guesses. But as you live in your house, you can begin to see the patterns.
Some of it has been that we have more stuff than we can store, or some spots are harder to clean. And that we have more 'catch all' spots than we should. When you first live in a place, you just put stuff anywhere. But after a while I started to notice the pattern of rooms that stay messy, or other spots that stay cluttered.


We've been going through a organizing process that is like the following;

# Step 1 - Take inventory of your home.
Crate a google doc, or trello board to keep track of all this stuff.
We live in a 1,000 square foot, 3 bedroom house. I advise taking inventory of the space you're dealing with on a large, and small level;

## Office (Room 1)
- Book shelves
- Dresser
- Closet

## kid room
## hall closet
## pantry areas
## basket wall
## Bathroom



# Step 2 - Admit to Domestic living
Do you have a designated silverware drawer? Of course you do. It makes your life easier knowing where all your forks are. No searching when it's time to eat. There are other supplies that need to have that same level of structure. I list the following;
- medicines
- towels
- tools
- dirty clothes
- food
- toys
- clothes
- makeup
- books
- mail
- cleaning supplies
- school supplies

# Step 3 - Identify what ares of house are multi-purpose areas
Do you have a junk drawer? Of course you do. They are our 'catch all spots'. But if you are not careful, the random spots in your house will become junk drawers. I suggest taking inventory of areas in your home that are multi-purpose, but you don't want them combining into junk.

We have four such areas;

- Basket wall
- Closet hallway
- Office closet
- Kid closet

# Step 4 - Set a purpose of each space
Now, begin to create purposes for your multi-purpose spots. Since you've listed out your domestic living needs, this should be pretty straight forward.
For example, based on how we've been living - we decided to make the basket wall be the following;

## Basket wall
- mail
- in/out stroage (keys)
- school supplies
- table activites
- music

# Step 5 Sort
Now it's time to do some real work! Now that you have a plan of what you want to do, this is where you start to make it happen.

## 1. four containers
Plan to spend an hour and take a small section. You're going to need 4 containers;
- trashcan
- box for giveaway
- 2 laundry baskets (keep and store)

## 2. Take everything out of the space.
It's going to get messier before it gets cleaner;

### Sort into 4 piles

1. keep (use)
2. keep (store) - send these to the garage for time being
3. Give away
4. throw away

## 3. put the keep,use stuff back casually
## 4. once the entire space has been cleared up, then start to organize it.

# Step 6 - Create a Keep Store Pile
As you go throw projects, compile everything into a garage pile.

# Step 7 - Build
You may discover that you want towels in the bathroom, but don't have enough space. Only at the time when everything is cleaned out that you can begin to think of buying shelves, hooks, trunks, or baskets.

Design each space as you would want to live in it.
