# No Other gods

What if the commandment “no other gods before me” is really about how one views self. What if He is saying - as long as you think you are a god, you will not allowed in my kingdom. I’ve done that before and it doesn’t work out well.

if ‘other gods’ are not really gods but a view of things that hold power, aren’t we all guilty of thinking we hold power to save ourselves in some form or fashion?

We tend to hear that as an outdated commandment. thinking that it related to statutes. That we think of it as idols. Some astute sermons will try to make material items our idols and convince you not to worship those other things. While that may be true, I think a god is something much more alive. But what if God is telling you that your power is a real thing in that it competes with God. What if He is saying - as long as you think you are a god, you will not allowed in my kingdom. I’ve done that before and it doesn’t work out well.


## The secret war

Satan knows what you want to hear. You want to hear that you can do it. That you are smart, persistent and you can make it if you try hard enough. 

The stories we watch, the feel good stories are made that way to perpetuate and indoctrinate you with this message - that you have the power. 

The stories that make us feel good are the ones that we can relate with the character in such a way that we could be the hero in the deal. The closer the story makes me feel like I lived that experience, and came out on top - the more I like that story.

## But that is wrong.

The real story is I have no power. I am a servant and have no more power than the grass of the field. I have been created with the same dna, but I have a conscious. That conscious has been tricked and I have taken the apple of the serpent and eaten it in an effort to be like God. 

## The story template is flawed

Donald Miller came out explaining that we love a good story. He discussed the keys to it and we all agreed. What an eloquent speech. Unfortunately he led you astray. 

There is one hero and it is not you. You are not the hero. Do you want the truth or a message that makes you feel good. A mental high.


## We are not gods

What does it mean to be a god? It means that you lord over people and things with an impression that you are something of power and value in and of yourself. gods live as though they are the top of the food chain. They are living in a false reality and by definition are insane.
