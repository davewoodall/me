Sunday's video served it's purpose of starting some conversations. The unfortunate thing was we ran out of time.

I noticed 2 truths that I wasn't able to address;

1. Work is serving, not being served.

A health economy provides value, like selling us iWatches for $10,000 http://www.wired.com/2015/03/yes-theres-market-10000-apple-watch/. But what is value? Value is offering something to people who cannot or do not want to do it themselves. So in essence the buyer is the role of the king/queen. The person offering a service, is serving (aka a servant). I find it interesting that the way to aquire wealth in this world is to take on the form of a servant. The rub though is in our work, we often want to be served and honored with a higher title and more power to have others serve. (That's the "R" rated version I would have liked to have seen addressed. People serving even when they want to be served.)

[Christ] made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death-- even death on a cross! Philippians 2:6&7

2. The economy is insignificant.

The economy suggests it is the system in which sustains us. That work is how we survive. But in reality the economy is just a way to keep score if you want to keep score of fleeting riches. People can look to the Lord who promises to meet our needs by any means necessary.

Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone, for they will surely sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle. Proverbs 23:5

And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:19
