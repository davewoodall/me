Hey Dad,

As you know, I’ve been processing a lot about my life. 

This Summer I was able to realize that I had arrived at a level with software, and employment that I wasn’t at risk of being let go for a lack of my skills. 

That accomplishment felt like a level ground to take a few minutes to breath. As I realized I was out of _survival mode_ I was able to access where I was and evaluate some things about my life. I started looking around at my track record and things that came to surface were the events that include;

- losing Olivia
- losing Jake
- losing AMB3R
- unemployed for a total of 9 months over a 2 year period
- homeless for 8 months
- Married for 10 years

As I reflected on events, I was able to have some time to think about who I am and have become over the years. At 37, I realize that I have arrived at a place and goal that I wanted since at least 17. Which is, providing for my family with work that I enjoy. 

During these last few months, I have also begun to understand more about the Old man vs. New man. And how my Old man seeks and desires Health and Wealth unto royal treatment. I find that I was pursuing a lot of things out of a personal sense of glory-seeking. 

All in all, the voice of the New man in me is beginning to be represented and I am seeing how I needed my journey to become the man God has prepared for me to become.

One of the challenges of late and that I’m working through is my marriage. Danae feels that I have not treated her well or respected her and I can see what she means. I feel like I don’t really know her. That lead me down some thoughts of origin as to why I might not be treating her as I should.

I started thinking about how I started marriage, at 26. And, through this whole process, I found myself wondering who I was when I married Danae. Only after these few months have I begun to see that I have been carrying a high level of anxiety for nearly 20 years. 

I see how, since around 17 years old, when I was about to leave the house, I feel like I was ill prepared for what I was to encounter. Specifics such as personal employment, financial management, and clarity on the future.

All in all, I stand at 37 confused about our relationship and a bit unclear. I find that I am curious and have some questions as I seek to better understand myself and views about life.

I view that I had 3 childhood phases;

- Orlando
- NOVA
- Liberty 

I put liberty in there because I view these 18 - 20 year old CU students as Kids. And, I assume you, at 40 years old would have viewed me at 17, as a child too. 

My question would be in terms of your active interest in my life during those years. 

- What did we do together to bond?
- What did you want me to know?
- What preparations for me to become a man were made?
- How often did we talk about 
-- skills, interests, finances, career, plans, purpose, college, marriage, employment?
- Did you make attempts to introduce me to constructive activities during the NOVA years?
- What did we practice?
- How far out did you think about your children’s future?
- how did you prepare me for marriage?
- how much 1 on 1 time did we spend together?
- what were some of your ways / attempts to connect with me?
- what are things you wanted to instill in me?
- is there anything you wanted me to become? if so, how did you approach it?

## Even more broadly, I’m curious of your thoughts about
- What is the role of a father?
- What is a father’s primary duties?
- what is the role of a husband?
- what is the role of a father now that his children are out of the house?

Hey Dad,

There are 3 parts to this.

## 1. Trust in God that He is working this all for good.

## 2. Current status with life
- got my job - not getting fired
- processing setback and faliure
- processing olivia
- processing marriage
- seeing the difference between the new and old man

## 3. Taking a look at myself means taking a look at who and why I am who I am.
- filled with anxiety for 20 years
- good memory
- no memories of proactive parenting

## 4. Wondering what our relationship looks like moving forward 
- ‘thinking of you [stop]’ 
- ‘insert same statement here’
- provide weather
- ‘how are you doing?’ is not a question

I see very clearly there are two ‘men’ at play in me. The New man and the old man. The New man see’s clearly how all things work together for good. He is the man in me that Christ is renewing. 

The old man has to die off and has issues with life not working out the way. I am still trying to detach myself from feelings that I can tell originate from that old man.

Currently, Danae and I are going through a pretty rough time. And while I feel that our circumstances add to stress, it has come to both our attention that I was not really prepared for marriage. 

That I can be very insensitive and uncaring to her. I’m realizing that I don’t have a strong sense on how to treat her as a woman.

Part of my time apart has allowed me to spend time reflecting and processing a lot. I started thinking about my childhood one day and had many memories of all my friends growing up and doing activities with them - nintendo, bikes, baseball, spring lake, and more. I found myself realizing that I have a pretty good recollection of my life in Orland and in NOVA. 

I have memories of logistics of food, shelter, and transportation. As well as memories of me reaching out for guidance or desire for you to throw a baseball with me, take me to a show or game.  I can also recall the time I asked you to play a simple game of dots and boxes while living in Orlando. You got up from the table and while you were away I cheated by drawing a few lines. You noticed, reprimanded me and said that you don’t play with cheaters and left. I think back at that and wonder why you wouldn’t have used that as a teaching moment and explained to me that we are men of character and cheating is not something we need to do as men of God.

At 37, I am at a place where I can say I found a job I like and pays well. It took me 20 years to find this. I hid in entrepreneurship because it was a noble way of describing myself as I fumbled in life trying to figure out the basics. 

The part I recently realized, is that I have trouble recalling proactive memories that you and I share. Here are the ones that I can recall;
- Helping me buy my first car, the citation. 
- Talking to me about saving myself for marriage
- Telling me on a few occasions that you didn’t know how to direct me in my career.

I am left wondering where you were. I can accept that you didn’t  know how to guild me in a career. But there are other aspects of support that I have trouble recalling. Like, why we didn’t explore what my interests would have been growing up. Having engaging discussions about college.

Danae has started confronting some issues about me that I have wanted help with. But I am realizing that I have lived at least the last 20 years, since I was in college, with a substantial amount of anxiety. Specifically about;
- my career
- my direction
- my purpose
- my wife
- my finances
- my employment

As nothing was established, I scrabbled to find what the right thing to do was. As I found Danae on the way out of collage (My last semester), if I am honest, A lot of it was due to anxiety that I didn’t want to leave college unmarried. I had come to believe indirectly that college is where you found a wife. 

I am grateful that you forwarded me onto Kurt Lang about Cat Math Do. I sent him an email and never heard back. I think you are aware that was a hobby of mine, but I never heard any follow up from you about the project or Kurt’s participation. 

I am just left confused right now as to what our relationship is. As far as I can tell, you have been more than generous over the years to help me financially.

This term of giving me space has been one that I have felt since Orlando. I have had more space from you than closeness.

How I connect those two, is I think back on how we were growing up and I know you had challenges with your father, but I don’t have much insight as to how you prepared me for treating a woman, being married, managing finances, discovering what I am made and my interests. I also wonder why the several encounters with the police in NOVA didn’t spark you to investigate how to get me into some productive habits, hobbies, or surroundings. It is clear that I was floundering.

I am processing these things with a realization that the Lord has and is working all those things together for good. But I am still having trouble as I reflect that my old man is confused and wonders where you were or what you were doing. 

I think about how I have virtually no relationship with Rebekah and that I wonder why we couldn’t have practiced treating a woman with respect and honor as we grew up. 

As I process these thoughts, I begin to have a new perspective for Michael too. How, if we were as alone as it feels, I can see how he developed certain bad habits that were not tended, or trained to. How he and I were never really taught how to be as brothers who respect and understand each other. 

I just wanted you to know what I’m processing below the surface and not really sure where to go from here. But as I’ve said the last few encounters, I don’t have much capacity for surface things right now.

We can talk about these things after you have had some time to process them too.

Love you,
Dave
