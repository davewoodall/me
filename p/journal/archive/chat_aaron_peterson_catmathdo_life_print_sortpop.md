Dave Woodall:
    why dont you help me sell this...

    it’s like t-shirts (printing / design / awesome) but not as expensive, better profit margins 80%, unique so we can franchise and grow the catmathdo brand (money edition, etc)
    i’m already doing this - just offering you a seat in the convertable sportscar
    view more if you must at catmathdo.com
Aaron Peterson:
    Haha I love fast cars! 
    I wonder if you could sell it through a "network marketing" type of approach. Any kind of program (health shakes, protein drinks, makeup, kitchen crap, etc) like that are huge.  Just a random off the cuff thought 
Dave Woodall:
    do it
    i just need 12 weeks from PO to delivery
Aaron Peterson:
    I guess those programs are more consumable goods tho
Dave Woodall:
    minimum 5,000 qty
    so you can slice that 5,000 orders however you can / need
    we’ll split the profit 50%/50%
    you can use your profit to market more games or invest in other ventures
    and we have a mentor - dave yearick!
    he’s already repped it for me at a New York game tradeshow
    it’s church clothes 2.0
    he also gave me pretty much one piece of feedback from the number 1, biggest buyer (i.e. real paying customer) and i figured out how to make the change. just did it and that was for the “educational game” not to be competitive. so I changed the objective without compromising the game
    
    rather than the game over when one player wins. play until everyone reaches 10
    but your role is like the wolf. (not ‘of wall street’ but of pulp fiction)
    i call you and you make 5,000 orders happen.
    that’s the role of a chief marketing officer
    CMO
    i’m the CPO - chief product officer
Aaron Peterson:
    What's my lunch budget?
Dave Woodall:
    you say to me - put some pretty pictures on something i can make money on, bitch
    and you go pimp my goods
    i’m the bitch and you’re the ho.
Aaron Peterson:
    Man, honestly I'm not feeling great today so I can have a very clear conversation. So forgive my few words
Dave Woodall:
    sorry to hear man
    we can pick up later
Aaron Peterson:
    Let's do it bitch
Dave Woodall:
    how much would someone pay for this 
    File Transfer: IMG_1803.jpeg
Aaron Peterson:
    Not much with the writing on it. 
Dave Woodall:
    its art! spring lambs in a b/w shadow of death as said by psalm 23 in 1937
    as told by LIFE
    ITs a one of a kind
Aaron Peterson:
    Haha
Dave Woodall:
    or... we could make prints!
    so how much with writting?
    $7
Aaron Peterson:
    6 prolly
Dave Woodall:
    $19 framed?
    thats how it works!
