# faith...

_12/31/07_

Setting all these new goals and ambitions requires courage and faith. I'm curious though as i start to get to the nitty gritty of the details how much trust I can have in order to remove the nervousness i have.
For example, while we don't have much money and the home isn't resolved, that I would put the $500 deposit down at DU in order to show that we're serious...

I'm excited about life. I am excited about all the challenges and opportunities it presents. I'm seeing more and more how people are lost in their own confusion and complacency.
I am asking that the Lord would open my eyes and give me the right questions to ask; The communication to convey them; and the comprehension & capacity to grasp what it is He's revealing.
