Sales Pitch
So, Here's the 10 year plan
Liberty University needs more freshmen college students
Liberty University is sponsoring Circle Christian School at $20,000 a student each year - as many as you can send them.
Liberty Discovered Circle by visiting Circle's Satellite Campus which also happens to be based in Lynchburg, VA.
The Lynchburg Location of Circle is known by Circle as the Satellite Campus is an Apprenticeship Academy in the form of the modern code schools. However, this Academy is learning a Christian world view.

Vision
The Green House is located in Downtown Lynchburg,VA. The Woodalls moved from Boulder, CO after a [20 year journey]() out of Lynchburg where Dave and Danae met attending Liberty. Dave ran church clothes and a skate team while traveling the world with his inseparable friends. The local school system is ranked poorly so Dave and Danae started homeschooling their boys in a unique way of 'small business apprenticeship'. They began by housing 10 students from Orlando who wanted to learn about Coding, Photography, Hiking, Mountain Biking, Snowboarding, Climbing, Graphic Design, Cooking, Small Business, Painting, and Music.

Marketing innovation
And now you know how the origin of the saying
You can't Woodall on a Fallwell.
But you can Fallwell on a Woodall.
