## 12. We can do whatever we want.
In Christ we have total freedom. The way Romans 6 phrases it, one may think this freedom is simply NOT to sin.
But lets begin to believe that this freedom means that we can actually do whatever we want.
Does that mean we could paint and not read our bibles and God would be pleased with us living in our freedom? Hell Yea!
