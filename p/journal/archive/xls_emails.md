Hey Dan,

How you doing?

Last week LivingSocial laid off 200 people. In light of last week's events I spent the weekend putting together some ideas about LS. I've also been trading emails with the CEO and we've developed a friendly email relationship. I asked if I could send him my ideas which, at the time I had 14 pages of note. Now, it's up to 26. He said he'd like to hear my thoughts. I've been bouncing ideas off some close co-workers and Kim MacCormack said you'd be a good person to discuss this with. It's about 80% done but I'd love to hear your thoughts if you'd be interested.

Hey Kevin,
