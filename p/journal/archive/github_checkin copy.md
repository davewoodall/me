Hi tiania

I wanted to respect your time to catch up on the applications but I can't lie and say I was not eagerly awaiting the end of the 25th so I might have the chance to add a few more points to my application. I am going to go out on a limb here and explain two more dimension to my application. Peter Drucker said 'you can't have the hand without the whole body' and I feel like I'll share more about my 'body' so that you see a larger picture

## First, I want to code.
As I mentioned, I have been writing code for five years and professionally employed since 2013. Github is the kind of company that has the ability for me to take my time and 'work my way up.' I mean that in terms of understanding my role I am hired to do while also participating in the github culture. Specifically, I would search for ways to volunteer - to pair program or review PR's and mockups. I want to participate with the Github as a whole. http://woodall.github.io/dave-woodall

## Second, I am a former business owner.
As LivingSocial is in a near tailspin, I found that I wanted to present a case for a different direction. While this was not my role or even intention to switch away from engineering, I presented the CEO, CFO, CPO, and CTO a 40 page business plan, which I have provided here to present another angle of my skills as a team player. Then, GT was so deparate they solicited the company for ideas. I took 2 weeks to formulate my 'suggestion card' and put it into a 40 page document that I even took time to summarize into a single page on page 3. This is just another dimension that neither code or tech support would have.

The chances of me getting this job are slim, so I'd rather provide my intentions that I want to work with github for 3 - 5 years in the following ways. First, help where Github needs in a way that I can help. I cannot help with Accounting but I can help with code and git and improving systems like internal tools, PR reviews, Pair Programming, Founding Book clubs, and even providing feedback for company direction when solicited.

I want to start in tech support but if that position has been filled then I'd ask you keep me on file because I am more interested in joining Github over the particular job title I'm given.

Lastly, I've added my origional application of answering Tech Support Questions on this github page;
