## 6. The purpose of church is fellowship. Not building something.
I am a total Thinker and Doer. I am all about projects and accomplishments. But as already stated, not everyone is created this way. The current structure of most active churches is promoting, motivating and trying to sign us up to some activity. I don't need more things to do. And not doing something doesn't define my spiritual state.
Church is a gathering of people who are coming together to Discover God from all walks of life. Everyone is at different seasons and stages. Every person needs something totally different at the same time. God wants us to commune because no one has all the answers. By fellowshiping with one another we find God. We discover what Christ has revealed in and through others about Himself.
