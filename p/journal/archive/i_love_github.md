i love github
i prefer it over other project mgmt tools like basecamp








afer reviewing my resume and urls you mihgt thinkg i'm applying for the wrong posiiton. And 

While I realize that while my technical skills are strong compared to the average lay-worker, my relationship skills are stronger. 

And after 5 years of pursing the technical side of software, I am ready to switch to the _softer_ side.

After working 17 years in small business as an owner, art director, and sales rep, I got tired of working with $8 hour employees. Meaning, the things that interest me are not the same as the things that interest people who chose to watch cable tv instead of invest in themselves. So I started learning to code and by far the best part is the engineers I work with. They are smart, funny, whity, deep, and curious. I love working with smart people and those people use git, github, ruby on rails, python

Stellar English and grammar skills

Excellent problem solving skills – you might not know all the answers but you know how to find and communicate the solution

A strong sense of empathy – you are attuned to hear the question behind a question


Technical experience and exposure to programming

Customer service experience

A unique writing style and voice

Bonus if you:

Will love developers and GitHub as much as we do
Could effortlessly explain how Git works to a non-developer
ps - the way I explain git to a non-devleoper is it's like your mac's time capsule that backs everything up but for code. If you want to know how 'github' works is we provide the tools for people to explore their code's time capsule.
