If you were giving $1,000. How does your mind work? Do you think of buying 1, $1,000 item, or would you break it down into 10, $100 items. Or even into 100, $10 items.

It's a question of quantity verses quality.

What if you were given $10 a day for 100 days? Would you think of that same item?
Would it be valuable enough to steady plod for the 100 days.

Your 2,000 hours is your $1,000. You can do with it what you want.
It's easy to spend the daily $10, and it's easy to spend your weekly 25hours without thinking about it.

What you need is a reason to sacrifice the ease of today and invest into something for the future.
