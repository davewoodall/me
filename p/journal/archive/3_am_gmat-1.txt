3 am GMAT
=========

We have a new office for AMB3R. It's so nice, but one of the nicest
things is that there's a space for me to come here at 3 am to study
GMAT. I wasn't able to do this before and at home, I kept getting
interrupted. This is one of the small things that I consider a
blessing from the Lord.

It's 3:49am right now, and I'm about to start a Practice test.

Lord, I surrender this pursuit to You. I would ask that, in Your
Mercy, You would establish my thoughts, studies, logic, insight, and
strategies. May I crack this GMAT to a 700! I trust You and thank You
for leading and guiding us in Your path. I invite You into today and
all these activities. AMEN
