Leadership &amp; Ministry
=====================

Should leadership and ministry be goals or simply parts of the way of
life?
Thinking back on why I may have started to loose interest in Eastgate,
I'm thinking about the lunch meeting I had with Chris where I had
asked him about the room church he had endorsed.
His response, to wait until the beginning of the year for more people,
turned me off. It was September or October we had that meeting, so I
think it implied that we would be coasting for the rest of the year...
Not my thing. I feel like if I have one other person who would help me
in ANYTHING I would move fwd. The trouble is I can't find anyone who
is faithful. Am I missing something here?

I want to open our home, time, and finances to the ministering of
other people. I want them to know Christ and grow in His Life.

>_For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was
rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty
might become rich. _ 2 Cor 8:9

Father, Giving and serving are two of the deepest mysteries to man.
They both are opposite of how we are "naturally" are made. We are
finite in time and resources, so we spend the majority of our life
chasing and consuming our own agenda.
What is the process and path to allow Christ to give and serve through
me?

While I am at the place in life developing goals and plans, I want to
be reminded that the higher goal is that Christ would be formed in me.
That I would be as Christ serving instead of being served.
Father may it so be that I continue growing in Grace, knowledge, and
truth of Christ in this adventure called life. May you lead me to
prosperity, abundance, influence, and faith. I don't know how this all
works, but I want the deeper truths of God to rule my life and
behavior.

May I serve my wife through words, deeds, and romance
May I serve my family through my vocation
May I serve my community through my local church
May I serve my country through office
