_background_

Web developer at LivingSocial with a focus on Ruby on Rails, Javascript, HTML, and CSS with an interest in small teams who  pair and aspire to write clean code. Before writing code full time I spent 17 years in small business, including three turnarounds, founding two companies, selling one. I estimate that I've sold a million t-shirts and Art Director was the most fun I had for a job. I'm formally trained with a Masters in Finance. Yes, it's been an adventure!
