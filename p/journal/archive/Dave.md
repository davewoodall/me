I am really Inspired about life right now. I don't know if it's because of all the activities or the good coffee.
Reading "Success the Glen Bland Method" has got me believing that anything is possible.
On top of that, I just found this site: Backpackit which is so easy to use and helps to consolidate all my goals, ideas, and such.
