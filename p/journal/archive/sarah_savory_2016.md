Hey Sarah,

I spent some time reviewing our 2015 work and would like to make a few changes and it seems like now is as a good time.

This email is about
1. Our future working relationship
2. Joe
3. SEO

1. Changes to our working relationship

I have enjoyed working with you and for savory. The casual '5 hours' a week was really helpful for me and my family while we were tending a new born. I acknowledge there has been some turbulence at times but I think we've handled it well. For example, I recognize that rush fees and 'longer turn times' were hard for Savory to work with. I have figured out ways to fix both areas. Those are part of the changes I have outlined below for our relationship to continue into 2016.

a. No more rush fees
I see how the rush fees were difficult to manage and I would like to remove them completely. There were only a few times when you had rush and I would be willing to help during those crunch times.

b. Faster turn around
I am prepared to increase turnaround times to 48 hours (vs. the current 96 hour turn time)

c. Fixed Hourly Rate
Rather than have two billable rates ($75 and $150) I am going to fix my rate to $95 an hour for all tasks moving forward.

d. Minimum Hours
I order to keep my schedule available for quick turnaround times, I will need a minimum commitment of 5 hours a week.

e. Payment Forms
As is, either paypal or cash.me/$grandma to be paid on the 1st & 15th.

f. Agreement length
I am comfortable with this agreement lasting up to six months before renegotiating again. Meaning, we won't discuss these things again until July, 1 2016

2. Joe

Regarding training, I setup Leann and only billed 3 or 4 hours when it actually took me at least twice as long. If you need me to train Joe on everything, then I would estimate that project to take 15 - 20 hours to ensure the following transition has been completed;

- Github
- basecamp
- digital ocean
- prismic
- mailchimp
- design work

Additionally, I am more than happy to do that but I would like to be compensated up front for the training for transitioning and training him to take over. Please let me know if you want to proceed this way and I will shoot an invoice over today to be paid by 2/1.

3. SEO
I would have to check with Digital Ocean regarding the information you need from them. Do you want me to track that down or wait?

We can discuss on a phone call during lunch if you'd like
