Had a good weekend but also feeling like I was more active in areas I shouldn't have been. I really wanted to rest, abide, and spend time with the family. 
I don't think that happened though. I ended up waking up at 4am on Saturday b/c Oscar wasn't feeling well. Then, I took a nap at 9:30 am and slept until 11:30. 

We ended up going to Chicfilet and then Danae and I went out for Coffee. The thing that annoyed me a little bit is that I felt like my relational tank had been filled after that. So I was kind of grouchy and wanting to do my own thing. 

I also wasn't very soft and engaging with Oscar, or Wells. I just wanted them to behave. We went for a car ride on Sunday, but it was consumed by me just being grouchy. 

I woke up at 3:30 this morning to dive back into Code. While Excited, I also know that programming is not the end all be all. This job is not easy, but the reality is that my hearts desire is the revelation of Christ in me, through any and all these experiences. 

## Prayers
- To discover Jesus.
- To discover that He is always with me through ups and downs.
- Thy Will be Done.

_Lord, I want You to be the center of my mind, will and emotions. I don't want to fight and strive for my own things._

### Work

Maybe I'm just sleepy, but I'm fighting feelings of overwhemled today. I think it's because I don't know what I'm doing. Simple tasks are challenging for me. 

I like this in that it's what the Lord is doing to drive me toward Him. I will not think, feel, or do my way to security, or peace. I need not fear if the Lord will provide for my family, becuase He always does.
