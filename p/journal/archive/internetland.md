About 5 years ago, I started to realize that the Internet is here to stay. Big surprise, I know.
I looked around and noticed that it had colonized our lives faster than Rome conquered Europe. I graduated college in 2000, and in my last semester some of the students were dabbling with Flash and HTML.

By that time, I had developed some contacts in music merchandise industry and was making a little traction in the apparel design industry. I didn't have any messages that I can recall that I should be paying attention to the web.

So, I went out to the apparel world.



I like to describe the web as a new country, I call 'InternetLand'.

Consider how difficult it is for people who don't know English in America. In InternetLand, HTML is the new English. I wanted to join that new economy without being bound to a translator because there is more opportunity in InternetLand than in America.

I knew how to consume the web, but I had no idea how it worked. So, in 2012, I sold my old-world business and dove in head-first to learn all things web. That makes my career path one of a graphic designer, turned entrepreneur, turned developer.

My current goal is to become a test-driven, agile, full-stack web developer. I'm focused on Ruby/Rails, Javascript/JQuery, and Slim/SMACSS. I haven't committed to a JS framework yet, but I'm leaning toward Angular.
I love helping people migrate to this new country like I have, so if you are curious, I'm happy to help however I can.
