## 5. We live in the Information age.
I know a few people who like to reminis about the good days of Matthew Henery and company. How they knew God so well. Well I say that history is viewed with a romantic bent. Every day has it's pros and cons. Let's look at what we should do with what we have today. Let's not wish for other times, circumstances, or experiences. Consider the parable of the worker who buried his talent. He's the one who got the smack down. Let's not bury our talents by comparing our lives to others.
I love what Thomas Friedman says in his book "the World is Flat" "Why listen to a bad teacher when a good one is only a flat panel screen away?"
