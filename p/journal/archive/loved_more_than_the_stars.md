You are loved more than the stars in the sky
you were made to rule by My side
you were born to learn you will not die
you were made to rule by My side.

We walk the darkness hand in hand.
There is no fear when I am near.

I care for the those who do not care
I bear the burden because I am there

hold my hand
side by side
i am with you
in the night.

there is no fight
i have not won
the darkness runs
from the Son
