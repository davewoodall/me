Letter to Ouray explaining my current situation.
================================================

Ryan and Jon,

I'm sure you're aware of my talk with Mark Young on Friday about
salary; I confess I wasn't prepared for the question and consequently
was all over the map. (I planned to talk references, which we did as
well.)

I want to clear up my situation;

I have enjoyed the meetings with you and your executive team regarding
the opportunities in front of Ouray. As I've mentioned my goal is to
manage a company at the executive level, ultimately a CEO. I would
also enjoy the Art Director role and the challenge to develop the core
value-add of Ouray as a market leader known for it's creativity and
current flavor.

My initial thought of turning Ouray into an industry leader would take
3-5 years;
Year 1 - My adjustment to the current culture and day to day.
Year 2 - Clarify new strategies to achieve goals.
Year 3+ - Implementation & maturity of new strategies.

I believe you don't know me as well as you would like so the
conservative approach is to take the relationship in phases, first
seeing how I handle the Art Director role. However, I am fortunate to
be in a situation with good momentum aligned with my long term goals
and priorities, and so I'm having to weigh your opportunity with what
is currently going on.

I am willing to entertain an executive level role or one that is
deliberately in preparation of, but I don't know that I can justify
anything other than that at the present time.

Hope that clears it up,

Dave Woodall
