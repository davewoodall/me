Jason, 

I was one of your first users. I started AMB3R and built it to a million dollars. Some of your staff like @chase, @others, might remember me. I was the guy who sent recommendation requests of all time. Flush with diagramed screen shots. That was 2009. I first heard of you by reading an inc call out of management tools. I tried them all as a freelance designer. I needed ways to stay organized. So, i went down the list in 2007 and i first learned of backpack. My first month as 12,2007 when I started backpack. I still have it and pay $7 a month and i can’t stop myself from canceling it. one, is it’s 7 years of my life. and two, i STILL haven’t found anything online that I like. (EVERNOTE == BLOATED)

When you had office you limited it to 10m or something. And I loved that sense of discipline and resolve. But I called and we ended up talking for 45m. I was the guy who was talking about going to business school, Kellogg even, and you talked me out of it. I knew you would because I read it in one of your posts. But I wanted to see how you would handle a little conflicting opinion. And you handled it like a champ and told me to look into writing software. 

When I couldn’t find one and ended up not getting into MBA program after all, I found Code Academy. I thought a good backup plan would be to learn to code. So, my family moved to Florida for 3 months while I went to chicago to learn to code. My wife is amazing to have supported me the way she has all these years of turbulence. I was the first class in 1871. I met some amazing people there. Like @this_many_to_count(twitter list). That was Spring 2012. 2.5 years later, I work full time as a software engineer for @livingSocial.

What I’m asking is if you’d consider hiring me to become the  maintainer and open source advocate for the project to see what me and this next generation can do with ‘dated’, open source software.

I do not have an mba. I am not a CS. or any other sexy qualifications. I’m a hustler and a fan boy.

Please don’t kill backpack.
