3/8/8 - sagmeister
==================

I went with hayes to a lecture by
Stefan Sagmeister
He said 3 profound things:
1. That whatever you do will come back to you.
In that your work builds on itself. I found it to align with the
principal of reaping what you sow.

2. That the employer and/or client who is hiring you is just as
nervous as you are. So to think of them in that regard it is best to
put them at ease.

3. He mentioned how he wrote in his journal some business decisions
and how he can go back and look on them. I never thought about a
work-journal, but realize that's pretty feasible with backpack. I
think i'm going to try it here.
