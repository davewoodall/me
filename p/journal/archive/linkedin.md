# linkedin 

We are the generation to see the invention of the social networks. Friendster, myspace, facebook, linkedin, tumblr, etc etc. There are three parts to a social network - original content, engaging with other people's content , likes, followings, endorsements, etc. Nothing new there. Like many people, I have an account on all the big ones. As I approach 40 years old, I want to put away childish things. By childish, I think it's anything that is unproductive or at minimum provides no reasonable ROI as I personally define. As such, connecting the two points - I'm clearing and cleaning up my social networks. I am done with Twitter, Myspace, and now LinkedIn is on the chopping block. But before I do that, I decided to look around. Truth be told, I tried to delete my account last year but they wouldn't let me. So instead of trying to delete it, I wondered if I could write some scripts to make my profile stand out per LinkedIn's admonishion that 'page views' is the name of the game. With the goal in mind, I decided to screen shot my pre-hack performance and see if I can impact my profile views. Now that I am writing code full time, that means I have to know how websites work. Many times when I'm searching a site, I'll have the dev tools open just to see what is under the hood. I did that with linkedin and realized their site was pretty stright forward to interact with from the console. Once I realized that, I started interacting with the site solely through Chrome's console.
