# Wake up

I don't have anyone to talk to about what I'm seeing. When I talk to them, they don't believe it anyway. why would they? I didn't believe it for the majority of my life. I was forced to see it. How do i explain to people that what they see is an illusion. why should I care? I barely realize it now. How would I even show them or share what I'm seeing. What am I seeing?

I see that the world we're living in is the equivalent of the truman show. That we're under the impression that things are okay, fine, happy. What's to stop me from believing that? I have a job, family, house, enough money for beer and my weekends are nice. But I am seeing that it's all designed to distract me from what's really going on. There is a battle that we have heard of but we file it in the form of fairy tales. Sure, we hold the bibles fairy tales at a more respectable state than peter pan. but neither have much significance over our lives. What we are focused on is making me and those around me healthy, wealthy, and happy. Christians summarize it as loving God and loving other people.

What part of the unseen, supernatual do you coneed is involved in your everday life? Is it as harmless as a fight with your wife, tempting you to look at porn, or shouting at traffic? 

What if your view of spiritual warefare is nieve and a product of the attack. What if you are more blinded as a christian than you realize? The first reponse is to kick it back to God and say 'why / how would God let me be so blinded?' What if you, like Eve, have been seduced to believe that the way is to consume the fruit. What if it's not God's fault that you are blinded. What if it's yours? 

Have you noticed that things are either categorized as highly material, chaotic, or fantasy? Why? Because then when you encounter reality, you brush it off because it's hard to believe that there are immaterial, conspiratorial, and real concepts that are beyond your comprehension. 

The enemy is under Divine law that they must fortell their plans. They are not allowed to pass the boundry of authority in this earth and must work behind us.The truth is hidden in plain sight because it's a requirement.

The purpose of earth, the experiences on earth, and why you need to live on earth are the marterials I intend to explore here. I confess the most cynical view I have is that America is not what I want it to be. It has been captured and it has become enemy territory. But, we knew that was inevitable. What then are you going to do about it?

We hold onto our views that what will save us in down turn will be our supply of food, our network, preparing for living off the grid, or other means of survivial. But the truth is you're still missing it if you're looking to anything but God alone to save you. You have not yet seen that the purpose of earth is to be formed unto Christ. Not live a comfortable life. When your time to die is due, it will be due when Christ calls you home. Not from your can of beans. You may die from old age, a car accident, a bullet to the head, or starvation. The means of death are not the point because we all are going to die. What matters is your heart before you Die. Your goals, aspirations, and value system are skewed and you don't realize it because you are under attack. You are bombarded with messages that keep you believing you are on the right track and that going to church and limiting your drinking is God's will. There are bigger fish to fry. 

To wear the watch. Drive the car. To hold a title and bank account to prove you are valuable. To be worshiped, admired, followed, and hold all the answers. To be one that others look to. And it's all part of the illusion. These fleeting trinkets have captivated your attention and enticed you to live like lucifer. 

You have relgated the bible stories to the fringe because they are lofty and impractical. What are you going to do with the story of the garden, flood, fire from heaven. Other than accept that some time in the future there will come a one world government, religion, and currency. Those are beyond your interest or awareness. Yet, those who express a level of interpretation and recognition of these are labeled as off. You have no better views, yet you dismiss theirs. That is because you've been brainwashed.
