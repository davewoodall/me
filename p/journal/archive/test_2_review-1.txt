Regression analysis

Output variable
aka – response variable
aka – dependent variable
aka – continuous

Input variable
aka – independent
aka – y variable
aka – continuous

                       Single Linear Regression

Two reasons for doing simple linear regression
1 – see if evidence of relation b/n 2 variables
2 – If there is a correlation / relationship between the two to use
the model for prediction

To determine if there is eveidnece of relationship – we do a
hypothesis test
we get p values
null hyp says the slope parameter if zero.
what we don’t want to expect
Alternative hyp -

  * <1% we have established an evidence there is an association
    between two variables
  * b/n 1 – 10% -
  * >10% -

                      multiple linear regression

1 output variable
many input varaible (2 or more)
output variable is continuous
input variable is continuous except we can have categorical input
variable and make it binary and code it 0 or 1. aka dummy variable
of all the variables we have, we need to figure out which subset of
variable we need in our model

We need to select a way to determine which variables to add like:
- backwards elimination – start with all then take them out one by one
until we stop
- forward selection – start with nothing until we decide to stop
- stepwise – combination of both
The goal is to create a model where each of the variables has small p
values

When is a multiple linear regression not possible with mini-tab?
because the input variables are two highly correlated and will take
out one of the variables.

Y = ß0 + ß1x1 + ß2x2 + ß3x3

Increasing ß2 1 will increase Y will increase
Decreaseing x2 will decrease Y by 2

H1. R squared (rsq)
How much of the variation of the output (Y) is explained input (X
variable)

Lowest value : 0
highest value : 1

Interpretation of the coefficient of rsq -
If data is close to line – the R will be high
If the data is far from line – rsq will be low

Regression model – every model has a residual associated with it
residual can be either postive or negative

If we take Rsq and make square root – it is called correlation
coefficient
Lowest value : – 1
highest value : 1
Line going up is positive
line going down is negative

If data point is above the line – positive
data point below the line – negative

If resisidual is large compared to other means it’s a possible
outlier.
Tey have High leverage / very influential point / that can alter the
line more so than inside the data points

Knowing when a regression analysis is appropriate
Interpretation of a regression model

SImple linear regression – response
“We have estaiblished an association between the two variables”

If we have established an association b/n two variables doesn’t mean
we have established a causal relationship

If we have est an association -
It could be because there is a causal relationship b/n the two
variables
There might be a causal relationship, but we just haven’t proved it.
If there’s not a causal relationship; it’s because there is another
variable involved (aka surrogate variable)
