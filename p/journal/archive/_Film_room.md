The camera starts recording when the game starts. The _game_ is a situation of consequence, like requiring a refund or missing a deadline.You should play like a champ when it's game time.

There is a film room in all meaningful professional and personal relationships. The pros know the game was recorded and the value in reviewing the film shortly thereafter. The focus of discussing film isn't to place blame, but to find ways to improve for next time.

Additionally, if you discover that reviewing film turns into a blame game, that's a penalty flag for team immaturity.
