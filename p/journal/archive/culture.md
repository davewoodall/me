## 8. Culture is magnetic.
My best memories meeting new people are when I'm in a foreign country or rich foreign culture. Cultures have sights, sounds, tastes, and ideas that totally expand and enrich my life. The body of Christ is the same way. The body of Christ if full of culture. What if instead of trying to make everyone be like the pastor, we let each culture flourish and grow and teach us about their approach to God. A rich and healthy culture attracts people.
