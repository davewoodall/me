found out 2 days ago that danae is going to florida for "3 weeks." She did this because it hit her when I said that I'm smoking weed because of her. Her mom was kind enough to fly out (tomorrow) to escort Danae, the boys, and marty back. Only issue is Jeanie is to afraid to fly alone. So Craig is coming with her. I haven't seen or heard from them since Courage was born and they stayed with us, in our room, on my 2 weeks fraternity leave.

Don't worry though, we've been splitting like this since we were dating. We met in 1999, my Senior year of college. Talk about pressue. It was a southern baptist fundamental christian Jerry Fallwell univeristy. To think, I had made it 5 years in a christian college full of college girls and I was about to leave single??? No no either I'm gay or a fag to which I was certainly neither. So I went on a mission to find the prettiest young little thing I could spot on the open range. I went hunting for my kill. It didn't take long to spot Danae. But I will admit that I mistook another girl one time in the WalMart. But that other girl wasn't as pretty as my wife so I was glad to see how the lighting worked in my favor.

So i stalked her. The shorted kid of the crew had a crush on her. It's a shame because I really liked Duane. I hate that our friendship went south over a woman. He was a really good dude. I need to find him again and reconnect.

Danae was only in College for one full year and because of the Bible college she came from, her school year started at the traditional, January school year.
So She and I met in the spring semester of 1999. In that spring I had passed many suitors who were also circling Danae. Pete FalconAarow, Steve and mentally handicapped brother, the Turncoats, John BonBrendle, and even my brother Mike. But Mike had many girlfriends so I knew he'd survive. Plus, he had another year at college. But he should have attended James Madison.

So here I am, Spring of 1999 and I am motivated. I took all of 1998 because I found out about sportslife from kanankuk, the sports camp that thad McFamous told me and some other buddies over pizza. I decided to go there in the summers of 1997 and 1999. There I met some camp friends but nothing enduring. It's ashame kanakuk got tarnished by pediofelia but it was an awesome time. From kanakuk, i learned about sportslife camp. this camp is wehre i first visited the west at 20 years old and where I met Hayes. Hayes is the most creative individual I've ever met. The only problem is his creativity is not marketable so he's teaching. And that's what I love about him, he stays with where God called him. I admired him so much when I met him because of his sports card coffee table, the duty wheel, and the 60 in 60. It was my secret goal to beat him. But the way I describe how I wanted to beat him? Was that I wanted him to respect and be slightly intimidated by me. And so we've sparred for the last 18 years. I love him like a brother.

That was Spring of 1998. UT ended in July and my brother Steve and his bleached hair flew out to UT to drive back with me to 
- denver
- hotsauce

- chipotle
because hayes liked to eat, we found a little hole in the wall on univeristy avenue that made burritos so big - I made devner a stop on a few different road trips just to show my friends these burritos. One road trip was the second summer of Kanakuk, 1999 when I road tripped with aaron shane shannon patrick. man those were the trips. back of the truck.
