Letters to Phillip
==================

Letter 1 - Take Charge

1/6/9

Where am I demonstrating this?

  * Financial situation
  * My education
  * Spiritual temperature

Where is this lacking?

  * Romance and non-business communication

Working with Danae on her lack of initiative and pro-activity, and her
procrastination regarding `business issues'.

What are my convictions?
1. Stewardship - Caring for the home resources and the finances.
2. Making the most of the life I've been given.
3. Living unto the Glory and Honor of the Lord

What does a Democratic home look like for us?
Danae has elected me. How then do I serve her?
Can I show her how/where the money is going so that she makes the
tough decisions.

Our biggest issues:
Lack of initiative / procrastination when it comes to business.
Impulsive buying.
My ability to be non-business when things are left undone. This turns
into anxiousness.
Romance and simple acts of kindness.

Lord, is this true? Is this what our biggest struggles are? In Your
mercy, lead us to a place of safety and love. We need to draw near to
one another and You.
