aaron,
first off, that God doesn't retaliate when people taunt him doesn't mean he's not real.

- evolution is not based off scientific method.
- it's based off belief that wants to prevent God from being in the equasion
- logic and atheism don't go together
- faith and God don't go together

That you hold such conclusive views leads me to believe that you are not as open minded as you want to be.


- don't deviate
- yes faith is faith
- feels like all these arguments are trying to get me not to believe in faith.
- as if you accepting evolution by faith is a loss, and also demonstrating that somehow you are losing to the people of faith in others.
