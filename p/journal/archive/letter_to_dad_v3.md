Dad,

This Summer I arrived at a level with software and employment that removed me from the immediate risk of being laid off for a lack of skills. Transitioning out of 'survival mode' gave me the mental capacity to stop and reflect.

One of the areas Iâ€™ve been looking at is my marriage. Danae has shared with me how I have not treated her with respect. That lead me down some thoughts of origin as to why I might not be treating her as I should. I started wondering who I was when I got married. I realized I entered marriage with a high level of anxiety that I can trace back at least 20 years.

Reflecting on my childhood (Orlando, NOVA, Liberty) brought me to our relationship. Rather than assume I know all that you were going through, I have questions as I seek to better understand how my childhood influenced who I am today.

I've have put some questions into six categories that I've been thinking about.
I don't necessarily expect line by line answers, but just some clarity about my past.

## Time together
How much 1 on 1 time did we spend together?
What did we do together to bond?
What kinds of things did we do for fun?
What were some of your ways / attempts to connect with me?

## Preparations
What kinds of activities, discussions, or preparations did you do with me to become a man?
What kinds of attempts were made to help me during my lost NOVA years?
How far out did you think about your my future?
What are things you wanted to instill in me?
How did you prepare me for marriage?

## Observations
What did you notice about me?
When did you realize I was going to become a man?
What did you think I was good at?

## Skills
How often did we talk about;
- interests
- hobbies
- finances
- college
- career
- employment
- future plans
- finding purpose
- how to treat women
- marriage

## Current tense
What is the role of a father?
What is the role of a father once his children are out of the house?

## My part with my wife and children
What is man's responsibility as a husband?
What is man's responsibility as a father?
What do those responsibilities look like on a day to day basis?
Should father's teach their sons how to be husbands? If so, what should be taught?
Should father's teach their sons how to be fathers? If so, what should be taught?

I am hoping to know and grow with you.
Love you,
Dave
