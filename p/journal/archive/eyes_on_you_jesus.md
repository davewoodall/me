May I keep my eyes on you, Jesus
May I keep my eyes on you
There's nothing in this world I need
There's nothing I need to do

Mother carried me in the first womb
My Father carries me in the second

Nations Naive
People believe
God's grace will not relieve
But their life is a breath
His mercy is for the rest

The powers that be
will come to their knees
His foot on their face
He laughs at their disgrace
