# Political Comfort

_1/29/8_

During this season searching for the next leader anxiety can get the best of me if I think that the wrong person would get the job.

I have found great comfort in the 4th book of psalms. That's Psalm chapters 90 - 107.

"I will say of the LORD, “He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in Him I will trust.” ~91:2

Say among the nations, “The LORD reigns; The world also is firmly established,
It shall not be moved; He shall judge the peoples righteously.” ~96:10

"The LORD has established His throne in heaven, And His kingdom rules over all." ~103:19

So do one of two things: Read this or vote Ron Paul!
