# James Call, 8/15/13

## we are doing some preliminary research, which is an ebb & flow - being that the goal is to make money, not simply build a website.

## what are the non-negotiables?
- high-quality supplements
- make it fun and convenient.

## who is the customer? (Sales rep or art director)
- companies?
- consumers?

## article notes;
point of view
algorithms + content
building trust through transparency

## ideas;
personas
trendlines
suppliment packs

## what do we have, that no one else does?

## who are the main competitors

## is there a mashup
- suppliments and shipping

## we need to find our customer
- these wireframes will build on the current site

## we need to focus on the MVP, and the next thing to drive sales.

## what are the page stats currently?

## Bring me on to helpe you

I hacked into my bosses computer and found an email from last week and it said they were going to fire me [3 days ago]

That's the extreme way of saying it :-)
