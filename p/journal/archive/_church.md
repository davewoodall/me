# the Church


I speak to my sons differently than I speak to my wife. What my son's do is also treated differently than if my wife did the same thing. It's a matter of expectations and assumptions.  Without that distinction, advice can be dilluted or misunderstood.

The same concept has helped me understand the church. To me, that term is often synonomus with the local gathering. The building you attend on a weekly basis. I have gained personal clarity when I consider the differences between the the corner church and the church which is his body.

I view them as two different entities;

- The body and the building
- The organism and the organisation
- The church and the club

The church does not need budgets, programs, heirarchy, or routines. All it needs is for two believers to gather and talk about Jesus to be an edifying encounter. The other brings in burrito trucks, movie nights, and other activities to make the gathering a pleasant one. none of which is bad, but it's not the point. Knowing it's not the point allows me to pariticipate in those activities without a sense of being off mission.

When I see them as two different entitities, my expectations change. Just like I'm not holding high expecations on my toddlers, neither am I holding expectations on the people who gather on sunday.

The point of this is not to separate the two or suggest that the 'club' act more 'church' like. I don't think it really can. I think both will operate. I would simply suggest to Christians that attending a weekly service as your sole definition of christian gathering will leave you waining.

Church is about Jesus Christ and who and what He is doing.

I am apart of the best sunday gathering ever. There are many christians who gather and we do participate in church there. My point is that when questions of burrito trucks, carpet color, music genere, or bible translation come up. I let the club pick their preferences and don't think those discussions are apart of the church, but merely club management decisions.



<!-- It's natural that the relationship affects how you talk to a person. That sounds like an obvious distinction.
We don't remind our spouses why it's important to brush their teeth. And we don't tell our toddlers how to count their calories. There's a matter of discernment.

<!-- The first entity has programs, budgets, routines, heirarchy, central leadership, and lines that can be crossed. Whereas the body. There is inequality. There are no routines. There is agreement when believers are gathering. The holy spirit is the point. Jesus is lifted up.

<!-- I think if you were to hold certain demands of that entity would be like telling your toddler to remember to pronounce his R's better. -->
<!-- Those are club members, apart of an organization, that meet weekly at a building. I don't expect us all to agree.   -->
