Filing with the State and Picking an LLC Name:
From here you can do things like check name availability and research the types of businesses available, you'll also have to come here once a year to stay compliant. http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/business/businessHome.html

Direct Link to the Create a new record page: http://www.sos.state.co.us/biz/FileDoc.do

When you get through the process it will generate your Articles of Organization (make sure to do a Save As on the PDF, their system is a little convoluted)

Applying for an EIN with the IRS:
Apply for your EIN: http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Apply-for-an-Employer-Identification-Number-%28EIN%29-Online

Pay attention to the hours of operation, I tried it on a Saturday and got an error, hit the Apply Online link toward the bottom to get started

If I remember correctly you'll need information from filing with the state to get the EIN
Again on this one, I found using Save As for the PDF to be the better option
