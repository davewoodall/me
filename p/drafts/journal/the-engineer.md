The town was small. You had no choice but to know everyone in your neighborhood. Try to keep to yourself and they will find you. 

The professor kept to himself. Derek liked that about him and felt no need to interrupt him. The professor lived 3 houses down from the Mitchell's. He had a lot of projects that made his house a curious one. Everytime Derek walked passed it, he couldn't help but walk slower and peep as much as was allowed by law. There wasn't anything specific that caught his attention. More just what could be going on in there. 

If anyone had a computer, it would be the professor. Derek decided today was the day to exercise his right as a small town citizen. 

Derek was just about to leave when the professor opened the door. 'Hi Derek.' Said the professor. Derek was surprised the professor knew his name. "how can I help you?". Derek began with the rehearsed manners. "Hello, sir." 

Derek wanted to come out and just ask, but something held him back. "You're a computer professor, right?" Derek asked with an uncomfortable edge. "Yes, that's right" Said the professor. "I was wondering if you could show me how computers work sometime" Pined Derek. The professor was so used to his isolated routines he just stared at Derek for a long moment. "I don't think you'll be able to handle it, son." "Why not?" Derek asked. "I've been reading about computers at the library and they sound interesting to me." Derek put his sales hat on. "These machines will drive you mad. Why don't you go play some football."

"I saw what you made."
