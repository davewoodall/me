# The Final Authority : Milk vs. Meat

_3/22/07_

At what age do you take an infant off baby food?

I know in black and white scripture says it is the Final Authority. I believe that is the spiritual milk that many new believers need to hear and claim. But I have discovered that the MEAT of the bible tells me that it only points to the Final Authority.
Paul prays several times that believers would reach the point when their faith will actually propel them into a deeper relationship with Christ where they will be wholly controlled by the Spirit that lives inside. The day that happens you have more "bible" in you than can fill an ocean.

" [I pray] He would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God. Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen." Eph 3: 16 - 21

This may be where I divert from the mainstream...
