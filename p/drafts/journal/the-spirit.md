# the Spirit
There was light coming from the crack at the bottom of the basement door. Who would be down there in a run down house? 

Tom was taken back. The light was coming from the person in the basement.  The other difference is where tom consumed light, the dark tom produced light. 

The person in the basement was himself yet completely opposite. Opposite in the way a film negative is the inverse of a photo. It was as though he was looking into some carnival mirror. What was white on tom, was black on that Tom. What was black on Tom was white on the inverse Tom.

Clearly this was a strange encounter that Tom was not prepared for. Yet, because he recognized himself like looking in the mirror daily, he was not afraid. 

Who are you? 
I am you.

Who am I?
You are me.

Two people talking being the same person was totally lost on Tom in the moment. He was more interested in the fact that he was looking at an inverse version of himself.

why are we meeting in a basement? 
because we need to get below the surface.


## Contrast
Do you know what contrast is? It's the opposite of what you know. When you look in the mirror which way does your hair part? It's the opposite of what you see.

Same goes with life, you think it's up, when it's really down. You think it's down, when it's really up.

Make sure the high life is held with an appreciation of rest and blessing.
