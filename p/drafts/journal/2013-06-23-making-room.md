Building a fake farm motivated me to clean out the garage. Turns out that 50% of what was in there was empty moving boxes, stuff from previous tenants, and other random junk. I organized the space into 3 sections;

_Things to store_

I consolidated all the seasonal things like Christmas decorations, baby clothes, and photo albums.

_Things we use_

The mountain bike, stroller, other daily things are now more accessible.

_Space for supplies_

After cleaning up everything else, I am able to have a quarter of the garage for supplies. It's about 30 square feet.

Now the garage feels like a useful part of the house, instead of one big junk drawer. My next task is to figure out what to put in there.
