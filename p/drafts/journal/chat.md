having time to see the pattern in my life has given me a real change of heart
a desire to change who i am and how i live
one of the things is inverting the pyramid of thinking of other people’s  FEELINGS first.
I realized that my definition of love has been highly coupled to ‘doing’
probably from my mom
and how one of the consequences of that is that if I’m not doing something then I can’t believe that God would love me, or take care of me
so i do as much as possible to stay in good graces with God, hoping He will look favorably on me and love me by doing somethings ‘back’

I totally understand. I think our relationship overheated and needs to cool down. Emotions, tensions, thoughts, are all high right now. Having a life vacation is good. It started happening for me about 5 weeks ago when I started pulling back from everything
we have been having ongoing marriage talks for the past 9 months and they have stirred up a lot about our first 10 years, which were hard
and adding that past onto current stresses is almost too much
I’m facing all my setbacks and failures - head on
they make me sad then i take those deeper
and discover these things about my views of love and people
and myself
and then, add on how those views have impacted our past - and future
i love you and want to be someone who makes you shine
as crazy as it sounds, i really want you to be forthright with your feelings and views about us. Because, i am not just brushing them off. I have new ears and want to understand why certain things bother you the way they do
and i want to dig deeper to understand you and how to love and respect you
i want to grow, change, and mature as a man, husband, christian, father, etc.
i was referring to my formative years, probably pre-marriage. 
but then ‘life happening’ on a shaky foundation adds to it
i think it’s amazingly gracious for the Lord to ordain events that happen for me to come to the end of myself
continuous setback and failure - enough for me to stop once I had a chance
Looking back, i’m saying ‘what the heck is going on?’
and ‘whatever i’ve been doing isn’t working. what is the deal?'
and ‘these tactics are not working, Lord why?’
and ‘why am I so frustrated?’
and ‘why are Danae and I at odds?’
Losing Olivia was the biggest eye opener for me
that this life is so insanely short and fragile
and that my tactics were not aligned with that real reality
then, the Lord shows me He has a larger picture of what’s going on and who I am and how I play a part
and that my purpose of on earth is to confront and be conformed into His image
not look at a car, house, or other ways to edify my life
