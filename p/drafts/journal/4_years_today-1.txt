4 Years today
=============

4 years ago today I married Danae.
I can say it's been quite an adventurous ride already!
Living in CA by the Beach, moving to Nashville, and all the lessons in
between.
My prayer is that the Lord has been using our time of closeness to
build a solid foundation. We have had no choice but to be one
another's best friend. It's paid off huge dividends to have few
relational distractions.

She's sick as can be being 7 weeks pregnant now, so I'm not sure what
we'll do to celebrate...
