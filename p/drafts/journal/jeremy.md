Jeremy,

I'd like to believe enough time has lapsed to demonstrate your full control of AMB3R. You've done a remarkable job as commander in chief. I admire what you have built.

I handled things poorly and I apologize for decisions I made that added stress to you personally and professionally. 

I am sorry and I hope you can forgive me.

I've been tasked with ordering t-shirts for LivingSocial and there is no other company that I would like to work with if you are okay with that.

If so, I can fill out an NPF and go through the process online.

Dave
