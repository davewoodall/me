One Life to live
================

Objective: You have one life to live and I advocate doing it right.

With the competing sects and conflicting messages even within the
church and our spiritual leaders, who's to say what is the path and
the way?

We are all ultimately pursing the same thing: Peace, love, happiness.

While we don't want to say it, we will usually do as much for the
eternal as we can handle. Kind of like investing in our 401k. we don'
really know if it's enough. I'm trying to show that you can know.

"The narrow way"

For those of us who believe we are living and interacting in two
dimensions, there is a strange balance that We believe there are 2
that our actions will influence the next life.

Common sense to christians is that we Love God and People while
keeping it up that I like doing that.

The Law is in our hearts and that is not faith. I cor 2 explains
something that we would need the faith for.

The gospel (purpose of earth)

God’s glory (a brief note why God isn’t insecure)
