# Day one
_9/3/13_

First day as a contractor with 3rd revolution. Lord, what have I learned over the past year?
I have worked through pivotal, meetups, personal learning, factory, freelance, and invited home. Now, I'm a contractor. I have no idea how this will all work out, but I want to do it the right way.

- Nobody knows it all
- it all has patterns
- use any cheats possible
- have good faith that there is something to reference
- when in doubt, ask questions.
- I'm beginning to see the end of super-green status.

Lord, I love You and know you are working all this for good. Thank you for the opportunity to start over.

- Follow the Lord
- Crash course on Javascript / JQuery
- get computer setup / ready for 3rd revolution

# Sunday
8/25/13

I'm sitting at a coffee shop trying to gain some clarity. Is my issue an intolerance for the wilderness? Or, am I sitting in my own mess. What am I supposed to do?

## There are at least 5 levels of financial status;
1. college kid
2. first job - paycheck to paycheck
3. middle class - margin management
4. above middle class - investing capabilities
5. wealthy - community impact

I feel as though we are in level 2, and have been since college. Thinking about - above & beyond, church clothes, futura, amb3r, ouray, factory, and now vacation rental partner. Ouray was a brief moment where I was able to combine with AMB3R, but it was for 2.5 years.

## The 3 stages of reinvention
Stage one - realize you are in a place you don't want to be
Stage two - begin to seek out change. Learn to change into the person you want to be
Stage three - live out the new person you came to desire to be

I feel like I had an awakening that I wasn't who I wanted to be, near 2007. When church clothes came to a close and futura wasn't materializing. It has been six years since that realization which has included;
- masters in finance
- art director at ouray
- co-founder at amb3r
- ruby on rails developer
- catmathdo inventor
- flipface inventor
- boulder webcamp founder
- mba aspirations

All of these things have been activity that have taught me something but haven't taken me to where I want to be. So, I find myself sitting in such a vulnerable spot. A growing family, an aging body, growing bills, but the income hasn't responded.

I have difficulty though completing a sentence on these topics without hearing the whisper of the Spirit reminding me of the truth that He is in control. Leading and guiding me in the way which I should go. The eternal way, which He has called me to before all of these current events.

# Wilderness wandering
8/23/13

This note is outside of my journal because I was to have been fired 2 weeks ago. When I say fired, I mean that my contract cut early. So, I unsynced my dropbox and have been working from one folder.

I find myself wondering if taking on debt to live for 3 months, to spend another 3 months simply learning to code, and trying to get a better job. For example, working from a co-work space and learning what I need by building something like screenPrintly.com



## On my mind

_Father, I am wandering. I am trusting You. You made me for reasons I know not. You have plans for me. I do not want to defend, but do well - the things You have called me to._
