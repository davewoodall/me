## Why do you want to participate in this program?

1. Hungry Academy
2. Code Academy
3. Sold my business
4. hanging out by myself but need to work in a team for 40 hours a week.

**Answers two of the following questions:**

### What do you do better than other people? How do you know?
Work myself out of a job. I've done it twice by recplacing myself with systems and learning how to train other people.

### If you couldn't be a programmer, what other career would you pursue? Why?

Venture Capital. I love building things and if I couldn't be the hands on, then I would do it as an outside contributor. The practical side of that is I'd go back to my connections from the private equity partners I worked with to turn around Ouray and discuss developing projects with them.

### Imagine you had a free year after this program. What would you build?


### What's the most influential book you have read in the last two years? Why?
