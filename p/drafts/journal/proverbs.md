Hey Coffee Talkers

Building on our last experiment I want to try a new and improved session. 

Whereas last time we woke early and just got to know one other and experimented with a variet of things. This time I wonder if we get very granular and specific. 

I have in mind a study on proverbs. This is not a casual ‘what do you think’ though, it does have that part. 

This is a study of understanding the proverbs in specfically four topics; women, words, wisdom, wealth.

I say we meet for 12 weeks and see how far we get. If you’re down, how about we meet near Pearl St. Since we all work near there now?

I think the first step is one that should be done before we meet. That is, to read the entire book of proverbs, all 999 verses and simply tag each of those verses as either about - women, wealth, words, or wisdom. 

Since we’re all doing this together, I’m actually putting us on the same google spreadsheet - so you can see what the other people thought. [google spreadsheet]
