Going through the homeless phase of 2012, through the prolonged unemployment stage while getting my bearings with software, and into Olivia brought me to a point of near neutral state. Where I was able to walk with the Lord and hear His voice in my spirit. He was so close. He maintained a nearness through Olivia. And yet still I can hear His voice, but I am so restless. 

The two weeks leading unto my birthday and the two weeks since has stirred my sense of urgency. That I have two gears. The drive to get somewhere with my career and life, and the other to stop and be a family man. That I want to participate in both.

There's no point in wishing that I spent my GMAT time learning to code. I was a lost soul. I was trying to find something I thought would advance me. But, the Lord is gracious and has lead me in a direction I would not have expected with software. I love how His ways are full of truth and equity. 

There feels as much pressure to achieve a high standard as there was when I was pursuing an MBA. But the difference is that not a go/no go proposition. Learning to code seems to posses a near guarantee of success. Though, not success in my ways, but as in the Lord is doing something slowly and surely.
