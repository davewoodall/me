Toil in the Dark

_When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were frightened. But he said to them, “It is I; don’t be afraid.” Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading._ [John 6: 16-21](https://www.youversion.com/bible/111/jhn.6.16-21)

[Tertullian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertullian) said that **“the soul is naturally Christian”**. Was he right? I believe so, for it is only when you see a man accept Christ that his soul is fulfilled and happy. Therefore, to be an unbeliever is to live in a very unnatural state. It is to feel disjointed, empty, lacking something, longing for others to fill the vacuum, lost, and very unhappy. To avoid Christianity is to avoid happiness, it is to set oneself on a course of self destruct.

**To live without Christ, moment by moment, is to toil in the dark**. Much of mankind is toiling in the dark, with their eyes on themselves and self-effort. And in this condition they are lost, frantic and within the grasp of death. It is not until our eyes are set on Jesus that we find ourselves immediately filled with all that we desire. We find ourselves there.

Why does man insist on looking away from Jesus? What is our fear? The fear is that He will ask the impossible–to lose ourselves, to lose those things that we have determined will make us happy! And yet we are sad in this state! We fear the loss of our precious little that has not brought happiness.
