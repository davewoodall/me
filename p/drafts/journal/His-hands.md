# Work of His Hands
_1/11/07_

>_But Thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. Psalm 86_

I am the work of the Lord's hands. He created me and He loves what He's created. He has no ill will toward me. He does not delight in seeing His creation not living up to what He made it to be. 
The Lord has called us into Light, Life, Liberty, and Experience. He is the fuel source, the purpose, and the very essence of what enables accomplishment. 

>_For ye are the temple of the living God. As God hath said: "I will dwell in them and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people." Therefore, "Come out from among them, and be ye separate," saith the Lord. "And touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters," saith the Lord Almighty._ II Cor 6:16-18

This is Not based on human stregth. I see it as one who agrees to the bath of the father. Our messy hands only spread the dirt from one location to another. We must acknowledge that He alone is capable of setting us free. He calls us, but doesn't make us. He calls us to allow his power to cleanse us from our impurities. While the process can be painful at times, He is a loving Father.
He wants us to come to Him as we would our Father. And while He is Spiritual, He's the one who invented the "game of life" He knows how it's played and what is included. We can talk, discuss, and offer our requests and needs to Him. He knows our perspective is short sighted, requiring faith in what we don't see or know.
