# Christianity
It's not what you know, it's who you know.

- people will tell you you need to know verses, doctrines, creeds, theology.
- But you will soon realize that knowledge and instruction, while valuable, are not how we are saved.
- We are saved by walking with Jesus through our ups and downs.
