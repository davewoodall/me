My mind has been going to this ‘4 part’ grid of: 
my desires, my nature / christ desires, christ nature
And  realizing how I’ve been praying for Christ's nature to help achieve for my desires

He’s all powerful, but I have ideas of what i want to do with his power

I assumed that ‘once jesus came into my heart’ the old nature would not have anymore say.
But my old nature is alive and well and trying to beat Christ and use him for my own gain.

Some of that might seem familiar but the new realization is that I was praying for forgiveness of sin's so that He wouldn’t take his power to accomplish my will. 
like ‘Jesus, I’m sorry I looked at that, thank you for forgiving me. can we go back to building my kingdom now? It will do a whole lot of good when it’s complete.’

But now that I’m not looking to build a kingdom, I’m starting over with a basic question;

‘Why do (or should) I care if I sin?’
