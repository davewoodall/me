I completed the course in June and drove from Chicago to Michigan to meet up with Danae and the boys. I had not seen them in 3 months.

In michigan I was listening to a series by Mike Wells. He talked about how the spirit is inside the Soul. I didn't understand that and was at such a low point I had nothing to think about but that concept. So I started asking God what is the Spirit and where is it.

Over the course of a few nights I began to have dreams that answered some of those questions.

I dreampt I was by a house. The house looked like it was built in the 1920's I walked in and there was a tree in there. the tree had fruit and i noticed that the fruit were 3 different kinds of fruit. Those fruits were the fruit of thinking, feeling, and doing. They were the fruit of my soul. My soul was a place that housed my mind, will and emotions. At that point I was also able to realize that the 'house' was my body.

In the dream I realized there was a basement too. I went down and found a campfire down there. At that moement i was talking with God and he said - we have come into your spirit. I said 'great what do I do here?' he said "nothing" you just sit and stare at that campfire. Okay, I've done that before and I like that feeling. I will rest here.

The next night I had a dream about the house. I walked in the front door and saw the tree. I went over to it but this time the light showed me that the fruit I was about to eat was rotten. No part of it was appelaing so I didn't want to eat it. I went back down to the basement and noticed the tree's roots were coming throught the roof. The roots could be nourished by the fire below.

At that moment I realized that the activities of think, feel, and do can be controlled by me or nourished and activitated by the fire. Okay, so my soul will not atrophy if I don't do it. I'll just sit by this fire again.

The next night I returned and noticed that the fire was not a fire. It was the reflection on the side of a tunnel. I decided to jump into the tunnel. Since it was a dream i was able to see myself in both first and third person. I saw myself sliding down a long tunnel but then I also saw myself reaching the center of a force that looked like a sun. My 3rd person view of myself was so small that I was nearly a spot. But yet still the sun in my dream was so big I couldn't see around it. It was a power dwelling insid me that was not of me. The campfire was a reflection of an inner, deeper power.

It occured to me that a living power could influence my soul's activities if I choose to live from the basement instead of the first floor. My choice was to either being my day by engaging with soul's thinking, feeling, or doing. Or beginning with a surrender to another enttitity who would inspire those things.

The different in starting with the spirit is that when exciting thoughts, feelings, or actions take place from me, I have a front row seat to know they are not of my own doing. I have a relationship with God who is doing things in and through me.

I begain to recognize the spirits voice

### use the parts from my blogs to explain this.
