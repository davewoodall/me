I've been unemployed for 6 of the last 12 months. Before that, I had a shaky business with a shakey business partner. Before that, I worked at a shady company.

My experiences had not translated to many job opportunities.

Danae and I are living Romans 5;

There are rewards for enduring through sufferings; but unfortunately, you can't get them without sufferings. Seeing that God is in fact in control and what a relief to relenquish anxeiety.

We also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame, because Godâ€™s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.
