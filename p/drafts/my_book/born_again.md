# born again

I was talking with Aaron about the cycles of life. In his words, at 37 he had nothing but future and activity and life ahead of him. Nearly a year later after being diagnosed with HLH, he says that in a flash he feels as though life is nearly done.

That notion of living life then it turning on a flash can be a disturbing one. But it also has a great sense of anticipation and excitement. That the formation of my life is coming near.

We have an old wooden barrel in our backyard that we we put some wild flower seeds in it last summer. They were beautiful. I loved looking out the kitchen sink window and starting at their variety. 

This summer they came back. And call me slow, but I wondered why the did even though we didn’t plan them. Danae so graciously explained that the seeds of last summer’s plants are what this summer’s flowers. 

A cycle of life that begins in a seed, sprouts and lives, then dies with a last task of seeding the soil with children.

What if this cycle, or the ripening of fruit are both examples of how our lives are. It almost sounds like a form of reincarnation, thought I have not studied that, nor suggesting that we should.

I am starting to see that I have went through the seed stage, unto 9 months of gestation and preparation until the surroundings in the womb of my mother completed their preparations of me. Once they were done and I was fully formed, then I was born into this world.

We did not leave the cycle that we see around us. In the brilliant design and integrity of the Lord, we are in that process again, for eternity. I am being formed before I am born again.

Those who say they are ‘born again’ now speak with a level of faith about the future event that will take place. That they are identifying with view of reality that has them not living for this world, but unto the next. 

The nay sayers tout that we live in the moment, but any prolonged discussion about that philosophy will eventually end in a pessimistic view that ‘hey we all die, might as well enjoy the ride.’ view of this life, which is false and cynical.

There is more to life than meets the eye. But also, there is more in front of your eye about life than you have seen. Your two eyes have been put to good use after they were formed. But not before. Neither can one see spiritual things until their spiritual eyes are formed. As it saying goes ‘I once was blind, but now i see’
