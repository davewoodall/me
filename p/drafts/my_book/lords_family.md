_To be sung to the tune of I’m in the Lord’s Army._

I may never drive a Mercedes Benz
live in a mountain house
Be a millionaire

I may never invest in an IPO
But I’m in the Lord’s family

I may never invent a computer game
Own a business domain
Clear my family name

I may never write a winning song
but I’m in the Lord’s family.

I’m in the Lord’s family.
That’s okay by me.
Nothing short of glee.
