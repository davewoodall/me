# Morals
- we are born of God.
- we embrace it as our identity.
- Our goal to be worshiped in a kingdom we build.
- We act like God in our own way.
- Because we are the Sons and Daughters of God.
- We can use our identity to propel us toward temporary fame, power, and wealth.
- We apply our Divine Nature in insignificant ways.
- But, what if we stopped and discovered the real truth?
- That we are Kings & Queens by no means of our own.
- And we will rule a world, but not this world.
- Not because we achieved Royalty, but because we are Sons and Daughters of the King.
- He is the King and there is only one Kingdom.
- His which we will rule alongside Him.
- Because He alone is the Eternal unCreated. 
- He was never created, but we were.
- He is the Creator and we are the created.
- How we discover this is by peeling back the thin layer of ignorance that compels us to rise to the top.
- A painful process that we flinch and avoid with all our might.
- Through pain, loss, death, failure, setback, and poverty
- The very opposite of what this world promotes.
- In the dark times we discover that we are sustained. 
- But not by our efforts.
- He created us for a Grand purpose that cannot be thwarted.
- The womb formed your body to function on this earth.
- This earth is the womb to form your spirit to function in genuine royalty.


# Commentary
- living this way feels like the matrix
- there are many distractions to distract you.
- hidden in the dark are the most precious of treasures
- all this world speaks toward our need for a Higher power
- sin is proof we are given ultimate freedom.
- God did not promise to help you build your kingdom, but He did promise to meet your needs.


# Angels fell for a reason.
- There were angels created in heaven, but not of Royal blood. Their power was so great, they thought they were Royal and acted like it.
- If the angels, not made in God's image, were tempted to take His glory, how much more would we be tempted if we just showed up without contrast?
- Here, we see that we have plenty of short comings through the contrast.
