So what are you wanting someone to understand by saying Jesus does not live in the Bible?
8:00 PM

to stop looking in the wrong place.
8:00 PM

The wrong place?
8:18 PM

What do you mean by the wrong place?
8:26 PM

I mean you don't have a relationship with a book.
8:27 PM

if you're looking for a relationship with Jesus, then make sure you know where to look
8:27 PM

I really dont understand what point youre making.
8:33 PM

Or who you would want to mske it to.
8:33 PM

"Make" it to
8:34 PM

i'm sure you see it they way i do but just explain it differently.
8:34 PM

Maybe but maybe not. I want to understand what youre getting at so that I can know if I would want to make the same point.
8:36 PM

the difference between christianity and muslims is not that we have different books.
8:37 PM

christians who think their salvation is tied to following a book are the in the same boat.
8:37 PM

The bible is valuable in that it points to Jesus, who lives inside us. If you are looking to talk to jesus, turn within, not to a book.
8:38 PM

Actually, that is a difference we have.
8:38 PM

the book is unique in that it points to christ.
8:39 PM

if you keep you eyes on the book and think you've reached jesus, then you've missed the point of the book.
8:39 PM

The Bible doesnt simply point to Christ. It is His words.
8:40 PM

You miss the point of the book by thinking its only an avenue.
8:41 PM

There's a difference between the tree in you front yard and a photo of said tree.
8:46 PM

Topic change?
8:53 PM

No.. Analogy of how I view what you last said.
8:54 PM

Tho that photo gives you smiles, it doesn't give you fruit.
8:55 PM

I dont see how that analogy applies. What verse or verses lead you to this understanding?
8:56 PM

You cant separate God from His word. Or, you shouldnt. Thats how cults form.
9:04 PM

Ha... I feel like I could give you the answer that you gave Cris. My constant, daily conversations, realizations, and experiences growing in Him have shown me that He is alive and well in me. I don't even know how to prove what i see
9:04 PM

Once you christians canlive outside of performance, they get to live outside of boundaries
9:06 PM

Youre trying to latch on to something here by leaving everything behind, so it seems, like performance and the Bible, to have a solid relationship.
9:11 PM

Galations 4:1-7 - when I was ready to live without rules, I took my rightful place and live as an heir. That happened when I saw that I am empowered by an indwelling Holy Spirit who may or may not speak to me with the bible.
9:12 PM

I value the bible the way I value a treasure map. The value of the map is in the treasure it leads us to. The map and treasure are not equal.
9:14 PM

People who read the bible and try to adhere to what they read that morning are living with a standard in mind they hope to align with. In my view, they still need those rules because they haven't tapped into the life of Christ to do it for them.
9:16 PM

Once you find Christ, you get the bible for free.
9:16 PM

You can have the bible without Christ (like Cris), but you can't have Christ without the bible. The lesser truth submits to the greater truth
9:17 PM

Sorry... Got a typo in my last text.. Rewriting..
9:34 PM

I mean that Christ encompasses the bible. But the bible doesn't encompass Christ.
9:36 PM

Back to your second text regarding the "Holy Spirit may or may not speak to you with the Bible." I dont read that in Gal 4.
9:39 PM

That's the beauty of not letting scripture interpretation be the point. We can disagree and still be unified in our love and pursuit of Christ.
9:51 PM

I'm not implying that the Holy Spirit contradicts scripture. Hopefully, I understand about 3% of scripture. But I'm having my own relationship with Christ and he doesn't only use the bible to speak to me
9:55 PM

The bible is not the gate keeper to knowing God.

John 1:1 does not say in the beginning was the bible. The bible was with God. The bible was God. The bible is not Jesus and Jesus is not the bible.
8:06 AM

Jesus holds the bible together as much as he holds the tree in your yard together. Both exhibit his life and power, but neither are the focus of my relationship with him. I see evidence of Christ in both.
8:08 AM

i love scripture but I don't worship it. I no longer hold it and Christ on the same level as I used to. When I held then on the same level, I used to feel guilty I wasn't spending time with Jesus.
8:13 AM

We have direct access to Christ because He is our life. That's a truth that took me 30 years and several failures to discover. It has moved from my head to my heart. I don't just think it, I am living it now.
8:17 AM

I also can see why fear of flesh, cults, and others would make caution listening to the spirit, but His voice is alive and well and I can't ignore it. But praise God for grace WHEN I do fail.
8:19 AM

Mornin! Did I misquote John 1?
1:45 PM

I love you and your ways.
2:27 PM

Word
2:28 PM

So did I?
2:29 PM

i have no idea. if you leave this discussion with anything, know that i've lost interest in debating scripture, interpretation, translation, greek, or anything that is not ending with Christ living the Christian life through me.
2:34 PM

scripture is beautiful but also the source of many divisions
2:34 PM

i will read it and share it, but i won't view it as equal as Christ.
2:35 PM

Understanding is why we discuss, is it not. Christ is in all and through all. Our knowing Him is ever understanding Him, which will last forever. 1 Peter 1:23-25 NLT For you have been born again, but not to a life that will quickly end. Your new life will last forever because it comes from the eternal, living word of God. As the Scriptures say, “People are like grass; their beauty is like a flower in the field. The grass withers and the flower fades. But the word of the Lord remains forever.” And that word is the Good News that was preached to you.
2:50 PM

Amen
2:51 PM

God is one with his word. Jesus and God are one. Jesus is that word. So yes by Jesus you understand his word because he is Word.
2:54 PM

amen
2:58 PM

You also understand Jesus by his word, which he is. You dont leave one for the other.
2:59 PM

danae wrote me letters in college. those have value. but i value my daily relationship with her more than those letters. they are both her, but one is alive and another is her life on paper.
3:01 PM

same... but also different.
3:01 PM

if you want to view those as the same with Christ, then that's okay. I see His letters, and His indwelling life as two different parts of Christ, one being more real in my life than the other.
3:03 PM

3:04 PM

i guess that is all over my head.
3:05 PM

Do I believe Jesus is the Word of God? Yes. Do I believe the Bible is Jesus? No. Do I believe the bible is called the 'word'. Yes. Do I believe people mix Word and word. Yes.
3:08 PM

Word and word are not the same.
3:08 PM

(1/2) Its amazing! But thats what it says in John 1. Jesus was and is Word. What we call the Bible is also called Gods word. We speak in words we think in words
3:09 PM

(2/2) . But God isnt limited to speaking in words.
3:09 PM

Okay we see this differently. Don't judge me.

sounds like you're trying to have me believe my photo album of Danae is the same as my living relationship with her.

I consider your analogies but I dont hold them up as a complete understanding.

3:42 PM

Right! So amazing
3:42 PM

Youve reduced your responses. Are you considering what im saying or dismissing again?
3:55 PM

ha - i'm at work and i agree with what you've said. :-)
3:57 PM

:) What part?
4:00 PM

That we'll know more when we get to heaven. That our relationships are limited by time and understanding
4:00 PM

Cool. But you hold to what you think when we began this conversation?
4:04 PM

It's not what I think, it's what I've learned.
4:06 PM

Ok I know you dont like the word 'think' but it is. Because Jesus shows me/us in His word a somewhat contrary understanding. Which is why we need His word.
4:14 PM

there's a difference between knowing something and living something.
4:15 PM

what i'm living speaks more than what i think
4:15 PM

i've taken what i've learned through scripture and life and have left the classroom. I'm not living life, not studying it.
4:16 PM

ha i mean i'm living. not, not living :-)
4:17 PM

there's a fundamental premise at the core of this that makes me arrive at what i do
4:17 PM

I have stopped pursuing God. I am responding to Him. I'm not trying in any mili-effort to be like him. I am letting Him live His life out of me.
4:18 PM

If He leads me to read the bible today, great. If not, great.
4:18 PM

I biked into work today and He told me to give this old bum $20 cash. I said no way! but then said why Lord? How about 10? He said $20. I said Okay and gave that guy $20.
4:19 PM

So I gave and it made my heart cheerful.
4:21 PM

if i did that because i read a bible verse that morning, than i can tell you that I would be boasting that my efforts to seek God are paying off.
4:22 PM

i have stopped looking for outside prompts toward God. He is alive and well within me. What He chooses to use to speak to me is His business. Scripture, nature, atheists, friends, Facebook, whatever. All is in His dominion

(1/2) Yes God can speak to us in many ways. But atheists and Facebook are not Gods word and they wont stand forever. Gods word stands alone. What we are talking
5:00 PM

(2/2) about here is the importance of Gods word, the Bible.
5:00 PM

I see those as two different things. God's Word, His Son. And God's word - a reverent way to refer to scripture. They might be the same to you, but they are not to me. But, I still love you and scripture :-)
5:03 PM

What I'm telling you is new for me. I used to see it how you are describing. but now i don't.
5:05 PM

There's the Word and there's scripture. There's Church and there's the club. The more I clarify, the less I care about the minor things that Christians fight about
5:07 PM
