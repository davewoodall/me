# the preacher
"neither injury or poverty can thwart the will of God." What did he say? It's like he's talking directly to me. 

Isn't my will and the Almighty's the same? 

The preacher had a knack for boiling theology to tweet sized statements. Or, maybe I just tuned it at those.

What I wanted to do was see how his theology confronted reality. Where do they come up with this stuff.


# the father
Tom would ask his dad if he felt like his dad would be as engaged. They didn't have a very close relationship.
