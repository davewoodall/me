Living for health and wealth is like putting makeup on a banana.

Death is how we become available for new life.


"Begin with the end in mind" is the 3rd habit of 7 habits of highly effect people. For those who get global with the question will also rephrase it with a question of 'what do you want it to say on your tombstone?'

But what if death is not the end, but the beginning? How would you live if you realized that your efforts to make your tombstone seem powerful was as meaningful as putting makeup on a banana?

It is through death that we can accept new life.
