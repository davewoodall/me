# The plot thickens, Peter Pan.

### 1. Growing up
This is a summary of what it was like for me growing up in a house as a preachers kid. I often wonder how true the notion that our parents generation had kids young but didn't know what to do with them. Maybe that was just my experience. So, I played war around the block and was living a peter pan life. It was good and my number one goal in life was to have fun.

I was born on 7-7-77. The first of four And the first of 14 cousins. 5 of my cousins literally lived next door to me up to the age of 14, so I feel like I grew up with 8 younger siblings.

We lived in Orlando, Florida in a neighborhood that was well insulated from traffic. So, we had free range of the streets, bushes, and surrounding woods.

We would play baseball and war around the block and all kinds of games. There were probably 50 other kids in the neighborhood that were around my age. It was not uncommon to bike over to David Franz’s house to plan nintendo. Play Legos with Kevin Lear. Play some G-rated version of Dungeons and Dragons at Steve Taylor’s house. Read Comic books at Tom O’briens. Play GI Joe’s At Armands House. Play baseball with the Mammon kids. Smoke cigarettes with with David Heart. And all sorts of other types of activities.

I also watched my share of tv. I probably watched every episode of Bewitched, f-troop, Gomer Pile, Andy Griffith, 321-contact, reading rainbow, price is right, and more. Then, when I was tired of those, I could always play some nintendo.

I spent so much time playing and could do whatever I wanted. Everything was within biking distance. The super market. The hobby store. The library. The baseball field. The YMCA. We would ride bikes to spring lake and spend hours there. Just me and a friend, cousin, brother, or combination of them all.

Calling them Peter Pan years was a tribute to the fun and freedom I had a child. But lately, I've relized they portray another part accurately. I have little to no memeories of my parents involvement in my life. Yes, I have memories of them in the peripheral. But, there was limited direct interaction with me.

My did give my brothers and myself one proactive talk. The 'Your mother and I stayed virgins before we were married and I admonish you to do the same'. Talks with Steve and Mike confirm that the conversation with Dad highly influenced all three of us to keep our virginity for marriage. Even if it was only in the most technical sense.

But, other than that any ongoing conversations with my father or mother about career, finances, college, education, growth, direction, purpose, talents, interests, being a gentleman, how to treat a woman, or living a life on purpose were not apart of my relationship with either of my parents.

I was a lost boy.

When I think back on that I have a few thoughts. First, I boast about how times were different and that we were safe to do those kinds of things. I can agree to that. But, I can also say that by the time I was in 5th grade, I was staying the night at the Bishop’s house who were probably 8 homeschooled kids. During the sleep over, the kid my age asked me if I wanted to see something  and he opened a bottom dresser drawer and showed me his older brothers copy of playboy. I had never seen anything like that. It didn’t catch me at first because the the angle of the magazine was more in his favor. I never really thought to tell my parents about it. Then, I remember being allowed to spend the night with the Shelton’s when I was in 6th grade. If my memory serves me correctly, Eric’s father was an ex convict who was somehow allowed to have custody of his 3 kids. My parents didn’t seem to mind to let me spend the night with them. He didn’t seem to mind us watching R rated movies. They had HBO and whatever else and we would just stay up all through the night as unsupervised 6th graders and watch whatever came on.

I grew up with parents who were not very engaged with my childhood. They were loving and caring, but were not very much apart of me. As a child, first I didn't know any better. College even wasn't something we discussed. My temperment is one of very future minded. I can remember aroudn 17 years old starting to wonder about this whole idea of vocation and occupation. I didn't get any direction from my parents about it. The result of that was I knew I needed to have an answer for something very important which I didn't have an answer too. So, I started to live with a sense of urgency that could also be considered anxiety.

That anxiety lead me to try a lot of things and become as one friend called it 'hyper-driven'. I was looking for my identity and purpose in means of outter expressions. This is the part of my story where I explain mba, olivia, church clothes, and other setbacks

Getting into this amount of death and living in and around it has brought me to realizations that would not have been encountered in purely successfull ways.

In these dark times, I found some unique treasures.

### 2. searching for success & confidence boosters
I wasn't given much direction on how to live life. College happened by the Lord but it wasn't an intentional plan. My mentality going into school and general experience would be a 4 year summer camp.

As first born,  I was a self-starter and began forming various clubs, clothing companies, and other activites all around the notion of fun and excitement. They were not born in any kind of larger purpose.

My summer's during college were spent as a camp counselor, taking cross country road trips, and backpacking europe. All for the adventure. I would say 'there's plenty of time in life to make money.' 

I took a year off school to work at an after school sports minitry and ski. I was 20 at the time. It was during that year that I started reading books. I picked up all kinds of books - self help, business, management, leadership, and more. 

Then, I started working at a landscape company and nearly cut my thumb off. I realized the hard way that manual labor was not for me. That was the catalyst to go back and finish my degree and start to figure things out.

I started a t-shirt company in college, a skate company, a music club, and an eating contest club. one of the things my dad told me was a chart that I subscribed to; 20's are preparatory, 30's are initiatiting, 40's & 50's are dominating, and 60's + are patriarch.

I made myself think that I was in preparation mode so I was right on track and that income and occupation would somehow solve themselves down the road.

### 3. failure & setback made me stop
My first set of failures were pretty harmless and probably pretty productive. I attemted to take accounting in College and I dropped out the first pass and got a D the second. I can't tell if I was truly confused or simply not interested. 

I genuinely believed that good grades would reveal the next step. So when I went back to college after skiing and landscaping, I focused hard on studies. I wanted to get distance myself from my previous loafing and perception that bad grades meant cutting grass.

My focus on fun must have blinded me to the notion that upon graduation I was to be a contributing member of society. I had been working with a skate team at the time that had all the signs of being a worthwhile endeavor, so I continued with that after college. It was also an excuse to follow Danae to florida so we could be together while we were dating. When the skate team never materialized Danae and I both moved back to the college town to regroup.

By this time, I was serious with Danae and my realization that it was 'now' time to start making money. So, at 24 I decided to follow my grandfathers role and step into insurcance business. I heard plenty of stories how he was the top salesman for metropolitan life, over 30,000 sales reps. Certainly some of that would rub off on me. 

I tried all sorts of ways to make money. Freelance Designer, House painter, waiter, telemarketer, sales rep, art director, business owner, multilevel marketing off the top of head. My experiences with t-shirts enabled me to work as a sales rep for merch company. 

Marriage had a funny way of making me grade my progress by my bank account. So the trend line was telling me that my occupational efforts were not working. So I conceeded that maybe I needed to learn some things to help. I took night classes at a community college about accounting and other courses. The habit and knowlege prompted me to think that grad school might be a logical next step. I applied to University of Denver and enrolled in a MS Finance program.

At this point, I was viewing my financial and professional setbacks as learning lessons that would correct me toward the right way. So, I began to find a new network to build some cool things together.

I was hoping to find like-minded people at DU that would want to join in and make something happen. I was entering Grad school a little older than others but I chalked that up to all my adventures. So, I was 31 when my peers were around 24 - 28. 

The disparity of seriousness in the program had me begin to look to bigger and better things. I started thinking that I should apply to an MBA program at a top 5 school. I thought my peers were at Harvard.

For 3 years, my schedule included:
- attending grad school
- building an apparel company
- applying to harvard
- art director at a day job

On top of being a new dad and desiring to be an engaging husband. This level of commitments created a highly disciplined lifestyle and routine.

I was so confident that I was getting into business school and that we were moving to Chicago, I helped my day job find my replacement.

At the end of 2011, I was denied from all programs. I had a falling out with my business partner, the house we lived in was sold, and I was back to square zero.

### Wandering
We started driving east from colorado with no clear idea of where we were headed. we drove 7.5 hours before we thought to call my parents and ask if we can crash there for a few days. That few days turned into 2 months.

We thought we were going to be 2 weeks then return to Denver, DC, or possibly Chicago. That 2 weeks turned into 9 months of wandering.

I had applied and was interviewed for a code bootcamp but didn't make that. When I didn't make that, I applied and was accepted to a second one in Chicago. During this time I was thinking I would use the chicago code camp to help me move up and into Kellogg's part time MBA program. I still hadn't given up on that. While in my parents basement though, I was randomly followed by Scott Whitaker who was involved in the enterpreneurial institued at kelllogg. This guy was exactly the man I wanted to talk to because I thought I could convince him to help me get into the program. We got onto a phone call and during that I discovered him to be a believer. And in the course of that conversation he seemed to identify who I was that that Kellogg and business schools in general were not the place for me. That my entrepreneurial spirit was not what was being taught. That the curriculum of the day was outdated and for old business. 
That call was completely unexpected and hard to take. Where was I to go and what was I to do?

In the course of that 9 months, I lost my business so I was now unemployed and homeless. It was during this time I began to understand what it meant to find the voice of the Holy Spirit and listen to Him.

The chanlleges and uncertanties continued for another year and half. I had restarted my career as a software developer and my skills would land me 90 day contracts before I ran out of skills.  I was on and off for another year studying and focusing. In total unemployment and uncertainty would be two terms that were on the tip of our minds constantly.

Danae was pregnant with our 3rd child who was due in Feb. I was hired by a new job in Jan and was excited, but also expecting my day job to last only 90 days before having to restart the software process.

In the turbulence, I had come to the realizeation that rent check, pay check, loan check, gift check, or food stamps, there's always a check in the mail. The Lord provides as He has promised to meet our needs.

### 4. death of Olivia made me listen
#### The day after.

it's like a weight on my soul. hard to breath. It's like my peripherial vision has blurred. My ability to see is only for the task at hand.

I know have a switch that will turn me off and tune me out to the task at hand.

I also now have a constant fast. When I think of Olivia, I will turn to him.

He said, don't look at olivia, look at Me.

He told me not to think of everything or everyone, but to only think of myself. Not in a selfish way, but in a way that will permit me to listen and obey to Him as He calls me.

I marvel that humanity would completely write off this innate voice and portion of who they are and suggest that it is not supernatural. Almost to the degree that I say, why don't you cut open your chest and make sure there is a heart if you're going to doubt it. I conclude that their evolution, atheist ways are their way of telling God they are angry with him for things that have happened to them. I feel for them. Wells says, there is no such thing as an intellectual athesist and I have to agree.


One of Steven Covey's '7 habits of highly effective people' is to begin with the end in mind. So, which end do we start with?

How about that in the end, we all die. What a downer!

(It might surprise you nobody has asked me to become a motivational speaker.)

That is the only absolute we can conclude that if another person does not agree, then all their other arguments are held in question.


While the adventure of unemployment and revamping skills as a software developer was happening we were thrown for an unexpected loop.

I was still in urgency mode when Olivia came and died. I was so concerend with not getting fired that I just had to pocket it. 7 months into my employment I realized that I wasn't going to get fired afterall. In fact, I had received a bonus. When it occured to me that I might be out of urgency, I was able to stop for a minute. when I stopped, it was like the sandstorm of my past realities completely consumed me.

I was able to see that the Lord was carrying Danae and I through two major storms. Turbulence and Death.

During the time of Olivia, it was as if the Lord was speaking audibly to us. He told me some things during that time that I was not ready to hear in other times. Death is like cold water that wakes you from a dream.

--

I've been unemployed for 6 of the last 12 months. Before that, I had a shaky business with a shakey business partner. Before that, I worked at a shady company.

My experiences had not translated to many job opportunities.

Danae and I are living Romans 5;

There are rewards for enduring through sufferings; but unfortunately, you can't get them without sufferings. Seeing that God is in fact in control and what a relief to relenquish anxeiety.

We also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.

### 5. treasures in the darkness
The death of a child is an event no one wants. It's not something you choose. What I can say is that the Lord is alive, well, and has reasons for what He does. Faith is trusting Him even when we don't have all the answers.

I’m looking at wealth and success as old childhood sitcoms I used to watch. Like a fondness for Voltron I can think of those things with a sense of fondness. But I have outgrown them all. I now see that their allure was something that was misguided and vain.

I think of my relationship with God during that time and it feels like someone who would walk into a cathedral and light a candle so to appease God that I was there. I did it in sincerity but with the misguided desire. Without realizing it, I was praying to God to bless my pursuits of my goals. My kingdom. 

Sure, what I wanted was noble in my eyes. But the plan still ended with me on top. I would be king of my kingdom.

But the Lord has done an amazing thing for me to come to that realization. 

## Confidence in the Lord
The sense that the Lord is my confidence is evidence that things are changing. God promised to meet my needs and direct my steps. But He never said He would get me on top of the corporate ladder. What I want is so conflicted with the Lord that I end up choosing to believe that God is missing rather than I am misguided. Is that pride, youth or both? 


## I have no kingdom.
The natural man avoids pain like a cat avoiding water. Nobody wants pain. But what is God doing when things die. that is surrendered to God? Only after my old nature failed enough times did I lose confidence in him and his efforts. I was ready to listen and discover a new way to live.

1 foot in eternity 
one foot in this place

I have no wealth.

Peace is with us. 

In my kingdom things are to be a certain way. But a kingdom can only be of one and I am apart of His kingdom, and so is Peace. 

His ways are not my ways but that does not make me try to fight for the throne. 

Children are in my line, but they are not mine. 

## the magic mirror
When you find the mirror in your spirit, you will see a reflection of yourself. But it is not you, it is God. Because you were made in His image and you look like Him and He looks like you.

## Confidence in the Lord
The sense that the Lord is my confidence is evidence that things are changing. God promised to meet my needs and direct my steps. But He never said He would get me on top of the corporate ladder. What I want is so conflicted with the Lord that I end up choosing to believe that God is missing rather than I am misguided. Is that pride, youth or both? 


## 
I’ve been thinking a lot about my relationship with my mom. I don’t know many details about her relationship with her dad. Just that it was a rough one. I only heard her tell one story of her childhood shortly after she was meeting with a counselor. I was probably 19 at the time. She was telling me how when she was a child her and her sister were on her way home from school and she was singing a song about how her dad was going to spank her when she got home but she didn’t have any idea the reason. 

My mom married my dad when she was 24 and he was 21. They had all four of us by the time my dad was 25. I was the first born. I refer to my first 12 years of life as the Peter Pan years. We lived in Orlando, Florida in a neighborhood that was well insulated from traffic. So, we had free range of the streets, bushes, and surrounding woods. 

We would play baseball and war around the block and all kinds of games. There were probably 50 other kids in the neighborhood that were around my age. It was not uncommon to bike over to David Franz’s house to plan nintendo. Play Legos with Kevin Lear. Play some G-rated version of Dungeons and Dragons at Steve Taylor’s house. Read Comic books at Tom O’briens. Play GI Joe’s At Armands House. Play baseball with the Mammon kids. Smoke cigarettes with with David Heart. And all sorts of other types of activities. 

I also watched my share of tv. I probably watched every episode of Bewitched, f-troop, Gomer Pile, Andy Griffith, 321-contact, reading rainbow, price is right, and more. Then, when I was tired of those, I could always play some nintendo.

I spent so much time playing and could do whatever I wanted. Everything was within biking distance. The super market. The hobby store. The library. The baseball field. The YMCA. We would ride bikes to spring lake and spend hours there. Just me and a friend, cousin, brother, or combination of them all. 



## Parents & grandparents
My parents didn’t seem to mind to let me spend the night with them. He didn’t seem to mind us watching R rated movies. They had HBO and whatever else and we would just stay up all through the night as unsupervised 6th graders and watch whatever came on. 

My grandfather was in the insurance business. He was the top salesman over 30,000 agents of Met life. He was able to retire around his 40th birthday. He got saved and became an evangelist like you wouldn’t believe. I still have his script down 20 years later.

“Tell me Tom, if A bomb were to drop here in the next 5 minutes and we were all killed, do you know where you’d spend eternity?
If I could tell you, would you like to know?”

I couldn’t have a friend in the same room for more than 5 minutes without Grampa asking my friend that question. It got to be so embarrassing and predictable, I wouldn’t bring friends over if my grandparents were over.

My dad was a preacher as early as I could remember. My grandfather had so many ‘intense’ views on theology and doctrine that he and my dad would argue about it constantly.

When I start going back to my childhood to think about my own memories and relationship with my parents when I was a child, that is the first thing that comes up. “Your father and Grampa were always fighting”

That answer was sufficient for a while. 

I don’t know what they were doing but it wasn’t raising me. My sister had once said it that they were ‘for us, they just weren’t with us.’ 


## Love
The point of this is not to beat up on my parents. But I needed to see how I formed some valuable views of the most important trait. Love.

When I think about how my parents love me, I see how my mom would seriously do anything for me. She was Wonder Woman. 
I started to see that my mom loved through doing and my dad was MIA. My mom served us all so well. Food, clothes, errands. She worked as a graphic designer and would take us with her.

If we are made in the Image of God. And God is Love. Then I had a need to experience love. My definition of love up until my 37th birthday was synonymous with my definition of service. Doing stuff. You showed me that you loved me by doing things. You showed me that you loved me by letting me do things for you. I showed you love by doing thing for you. I showed you love by accepting those things you did for me. If you didn’t do things or let me do things for you, then I began to question why we were together. A very legalistic way to live life.

## My career
My career was a misguided stumble into entrepreneurship. If you look at my [linkedin](linkedin.com) you’ll see that ‘entrepreneur’ is my top endorsed trait. That wasn’t something I necessarily set out to do. It’s something I stumbled into when I had no real idea what a job looked like. I punted on jobs throughout high school and college. When I graduated college I had the bright idea of trying to grow a skate team. I was living in a dream world. What should really be voted up there is ‘aimless’
I had no clue what to do so I tried a lot of things. My confusion made me frantic because I was trying to make money by playing, not working. My parents were not around to help sharpen me to explain that what I was trying was not an economically sustainable lifestyle.

The entrepreneur trait in me eventualy matured into a genuine desire to build something that would earn me recognition. Something that would prove I had value when I sat on top of it. 

I started a christian t-shirt company in college that I had mixed motives for doing so. In once sense, I felt it would be a cool way to do a good thing while making money. But it was just a really expensive outlet to design my own t-shirts. I didn’t have a clue about how to make it a company. Which resulted in it failing after 10 years of on and off pursuit with it.

Getting stung by going out of business because I wasn’t managing the finances was not going to stop me from success. So, I started taking accounting classes at a local community college to learn from my mistakes. I took four classes over a two year period before I sat down with my accounting teacher and asked when do we talk about projections and making sure we are planning properly. He told me I was in the wrong field. That what I was referring to was finance, not accounting. Okay…

We were living in Nashville at the time. Nashville was not good to us. I had worked for a company where the boss had admitted to me on a few different occasions that he was intimidated by me. So, when I came up with a new idea to and he ended up stealing it. 

During this time, the real estate markets were booming so I thought maybe I should get into real estate since t-shirts weren’t working out. I looked into real estate programs and ultimately found one in Denver. I had loved Colorado for 10 years and when the thought of using grad school as the responsible reason to move West, I moved forward with it. I was accepted to DU as a dual-degree program of real estate development and MBA. 

Before I had begun classes, Danae and I were at the library and she randomly found a book on the shelf that described nearly the exact vision of what I had thought I was going to school for. So, I picked it up and read [new harvest]() excited to get some prep. What shocked me was that I had realized that industry was not for me in the slightest. 

I called my admissions counselor and explained the situation. He said that I could switch no problem and that the way the dual degree worked, I could delay any other decisions about the MBA stuff. I ended up switching out of the Real Estate and enrolled in the Masters of Finance program. 

I was 31 years old when I enrolled in the program. I was on the older side. The kids I was around made me think that I had not yet found my audience. After talking with Danae, I started to think that an MBA is only worth something if it’s from a top 5 school. So, I ended up unenrolling from the MBA side and just focused on the Finance. 

## bigger story at play
but there is a deeper underlying story at play. One that can easily be lost in the eye of the overly rational man. Just as nature can be a winning argument for both evolution and creation, I believe my circumstances can be argued for and against God. But I see that there are larger reasons that a Loving and caring God would allow me to experience these things. 

## my heart had to be prepared
I wasn’t ready to hear the larger story until I had lost complete faith in my own story. It took continual setback, a lost child, a grieving wife, lost company, failed goals, debts, homelessness and unemployment before I stopped and had a chance to ask myself what is going on.

my heart heart had to be both revealed and prepared to handle the truth. That I was born of royal blood. But that blood is not something I earned. As a human being, we are all born in God’s image. God is royalty and we are His children. As children, we own what it feels like. I am of Royal bloom, but not how I initially thought.

I needed this family. These experiences. This season of extended wandering. The setbacks. The debts. The losses. To soften my heart. In the midst of that, I was applying my God-given glory to serve myself. That’s the same thing that Lucefier did. In this safe place called Earth, I am allowed to give life a shot without surrender to God. I can live like I am God. I can try my hardest to achieve the things that I think will satisfy me; respect, honor, praise, glory, and worship. I want that BMW because I want you to look at it and admire it and the driver of it. I want to think about you thinking about me. That when I drive in, I know what you’re thinking about. Wondering how to be like me. Because i have value, I have worth. I have what you don’t have. and if I own what yo don’t have you want to be like me. 

Lucifer was kicked out of heaven for thinking those things. I get to experience having them and seeing the result of those feelings. The leave me with envy, anxiety, competition, and all the things opposite of God. Because I don’t get what I want. What I want is my will. My will depends on my own Health and Wealth. I realized that it a key way to determine who’s will I’m living unto.

While I was swimming one morning and I could feel something was not right with my shoulder. I started to wonder how would I exercise if I couldn’t swim. Then, the Lord spoke to me and said what if you were to live in sickness and poverty. Do you think that would impede my will? I realized in that moment that my will was depended on my health and wealth.

Does God need me, my health, or wealth to accomplish what he wants? Do I say I want God’s will or mine? Then, how do I feel the moment I get an unexpected bill in the mail? How do I feel about myself when I get injured or catch a cold. I fret that I won’t be able to complete what I need to. Would a God who knows all really put you in that situation?

That’s when I started to realize that my confidence in the Lord was so low because I couldn’t trust him to come through on my goals. How can I have confidence in a God who won’t show up? Well, it turns out - He’s not interested in helping me accomplish my will. But as I begin to relinquish my own will, I see how an unintended result is my confidence in the Lord is going back up. To the point of almost physical logistics. 

## Larger story at play
There was a larger story at play


## Summary
Childhood formed me in ways that my old nature would later respond to with urgency and anxiety. Through those pursuits I encountered many setbacks and failures that confused me. 

It wasn’t until I realized that my eyes were blinded to what was really going on with life and why even be here at all.
