# Life and Death

I grew up with parents who were not very engaged with my childhood. They were loving and caring, but were not very much apart of me. As a child, first I didn't know any better. College even wasn't something we discussed. My temperment is one of very future minded. I can remember aroudn 17 years old starting to wonder about this whole idea of vocation and occupation. I didn't get any direction from my parents about it. The result of that was I knew I needed to have an answer for something very important which I didn't have an answer too. So, I started to live with a sense of urgency that could also be considered anxiety.

That anxiety lead me to try a lot of things and become as one friend called it 'hyper-driven'. I was looking for my identity and purpose in means of outter expressions. This is the part of my story where I explain mba, olivia, church clothes, and other setbacks

Getting into this amount of death and living in and around it has brought me to realizations that would not have been encountered in purely successfull ways.

In these dark times, I found some unique treasures.
