# Glory

I'm convinced that the more one walks with the Lord, that as the Jews say, you become more aware of your surroundings, and the fact that God is everywhere.

One of those is the idea of what Glory is really. I think in my younger days I would consider it as something of a goldish-yellow glow of brilliant light spewing out God that we can't see Him because He's so... "Glorious".

Well, while that may be the case, I don't see much of that wattage here on earth. So my question is, is that the only description for glory or is it more than that.

My thought is that glory is much simpler and yet much more dynamic. That it's anything that can cause one to marvel or stand in awe of another.

If you consider that things that really get people's admiration fall into a few categories: Wealth, healthy, beauty, smarts, and such.

I can testify that the more I discover God's glory in simplicity, the more of those simple glories He allows me to possess. In my case, I can say that God's glory in me is revealed through my ambition, initiative, drive, creativity, growing comprehension and capacity, and so far a deep well of ideas.

As I've identified Him as the source of these things, I believe God considers me a safe person to rest His glory. He is glorified, and I become more alive in the experience of it.
