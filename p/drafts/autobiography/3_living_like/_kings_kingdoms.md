# Kings & Kingdoms

In observing our true nature, we can then notice how much we live our lives around trying to get people to 'play house' with us and our own kingdoms. That we have a deep desire to experience royalty. As with all children, we need to be trained to realize that our first impressions of royalty are misguided. In fact, we start with a sense that we are the king, or also known as 'the center of the universe'. Why can we relate to that? 

It is said that experience is the best but also most expensive teacher. Wisdom is to  take heed of something without having to experience it. But what we have to experience is the ability to live like a King and see it's net effects on us and those around us. 

We discover that we are not as powerful as we think. THere is a great divide between what we want and what reality is. From things as noble as helping the poor to builing an empire. We all exude royal behavior in our own ways.

The story of lucifer was always a unique one growing up. like the section of dark magic you don't talk about. Like voldimor who we don't speak about. But that story has a very insightful meaning into who we are and why we are here on earth.
