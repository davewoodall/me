I heard a guy talk about how Jesus was not able to walk into a town because he was famous. And that he said 'greater things we will do'. The guy followed up with saying, 'when are you not going to be able to walk into town because of what you're doing for Christ?'

Why do we automatically assume that when Jesus said 'greater things than I have done, you will do' is pertaining to this side of eternity?

This body, this world, and our place in it all seem to imply that earth is where we set roots. Day by Day the Lord is preparing us forming us for the day are **Born again**
