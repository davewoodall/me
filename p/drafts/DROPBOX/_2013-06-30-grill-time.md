I was in the market for a new grill after making the mistake of purchasing a used one craigslist. Instead of simply replacing it with a typical grill, I decided to invest in one I could [house camp](/house-camping/) with. I discovered [Primus](http://www.primus.se/Templates/Pages/Default.aspx?SectionId=6720), a Swiss brand. I bought this awesome little grill on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Primus-Profile-Burner-Combo-Us-Canada/dp/B004R1KGBQ/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&qid=1372611808&sr=8-13&keywords=primus+stove) for $65.

This stove uses the camping size, 16.5 oz propane tank, so I bought an [adaptor](http://www.rei.com/product/710674/century-8-foot-hose-with-type-1-adapter) to also use the big tank.
