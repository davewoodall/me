Okay from what I can tell here's my punch list.

1. create a new DW ticket asking for new data fields. also asking _how long a string can be.   As its a comment body, it may get verbose, so if they have another searchable data type for longer strings we need to know that_

2. Then, add info to app/controllers/sfapi/comments_controller.rb#create

3. Then, once that is completed, I can check off CSR-1514

4. I'll be done and then go back to CSR-1493

Yes or no? :simple_smile: (edited)

Basically, Yes.   But DW will not likely get to this for a few days (possibly), so you will have to revisit as they update the ticket, ask questions, etc. But if our end is done in a local branch, then yes, return to 1493
