# 51 books in 1 sentence.

I didn't start reading on my own until I was about 21. I've probably read over 300 books in the past 15 years. I was recently reflecting on the books that have influenced me. I've found that a book is successful when it leaves one over arching point. Then, the real value is that I've found myself thinking of that single point from time to time. These are the management, leadership, business, and life books
