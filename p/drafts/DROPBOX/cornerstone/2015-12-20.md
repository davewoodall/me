## HEAVEN

### I need some Volunteers
- sports (ball into trash)
- build up 15 blocks
- raise your hand if you obey your parents all the time

let's talk about heaven for a moment - did you know you have to be absolutely perfect - only people who obey their parents all the time, who can never miss, build blocks

### One of God's commandments is to obey your parents

## if we can't get into heaven because you have to be perfect then we have a real problem. What's the problem? What's the solution

## I'm going to read a story and we're going to have a quiz based on the names of people, places and thanks

## So what is the solution? 

## Christmas Quiz
