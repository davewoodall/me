The two definitions of Church
=============================

I know you are busy and have many other websites, blogs, and emails to
attend to, I’m going to keep this short. Consider this the
‘introduction’ to a book in progress.

It has come to my attention after years of living in the christian
culture that there is a very important term that needs to be defined.
The reason is that one of the central terms in our culuture actually
has two definitions. This makes for difficult conversation and clarity
when speaking about this topic. For I find it’s a heated topic and
thereby the vagueness that two definitions enables allows people to
‘flip-flop’ with out much realization to the listener or maybe even to
the one doing it.

I’m referring to the the term “Church”. Before you begin to glaze
over, Just know that I’m motivated to begin on this potentially dry
topic in order to setup some bigger dreams and ideals about the
“church”. In order to do so, you need to know what I’m talking about
and I don’t want you to get confused or try to debate me with the old
‘bait and switch’

First let’s concede that the term church, in our american culture,
means the local building on the corner of most neighborhood. The
physical structure that many of us kid is on every major corner.
Some additional characteristics of this structure include:

  * A need (or ambition) to acheive 501c3 status
  * A building (or desire for one) to meet and minister on a more
    “full time” basis
  * Programs organized to help the poor, elderly, widows, africa,
    youth, singles, etc etc.
  * A lead pastor you may or may not know personally that is heading
    up the charge of that church.
  * A regular gathering that, after attending 5 times, you’re pretty
    familiar with the routine and schedule of the meeting.

I’ll stop there, but I would be curious your additional descriptions
of this gathering, or club, called the church.

The second definition, which is the one that holds the life and desire
of most beleivers, it the ‘church which is his body’ (Col 1:24)
It is the indwelling Life of christ resting on those of us who have
declared Jesus to be our savior. He has birthed in us a new life,
purpose, desires, and even the follow through by His power.
These called the body who have been born again are led by an internal
Spirit unto righteousness.
When two Believers are walking together there is a lift in the spirit
of those people. They are redeemed and edifying to one another through
Christ Jesus and his indwelling Spirit.
Christians in tune with the Spirit are led by an internal desire, and
what they believe it the Lord’s calling and purpose on their lives.
Older, Wiser believers are there as a loving sounding board to refine
and confirm what they also know to be the voice of the Lord.

Feel free to comment if you see it this way or another.
One of the most commmon arguments for the ‘church organization’ is
that of authority. I have issue with that because the church, in the
true meaning of fellowship, has Christ and His glory at the center. If
that being the case, is adding redundancy to the entire program.
I think that authority makes a great case in the modern mega-church in
order to keep everyone in line.
My qualm is, is that still a church at that size? Is it really
necessay or even possible for a Pastor to fulfill his role when he
doesn’t know but a small % of his own staff?

I propose that the ‘church organization’ has lost so much of it’s
power in the attempt to be the brightest, coolest, most know place to
be. That does not sound like the narrow road.
