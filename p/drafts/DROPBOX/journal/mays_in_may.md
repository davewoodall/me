## A visit to Breckenridge

Grama and Wayne drove to Breck to visit us. They bought us a room to stay next to them. They were to stay the week, but ended up leaving after 2 nights because of the altitude.

Seeing them brought up feelings I've been having and I just need to vent this...

For one, while Colorado is amazing, I've been here 6 years now. But for whatever reasons, I've not set significant roots. I know the Lord is alive and leading, but I can't help but recognize the feelings and thoughts that bubble up.

This place is  wild territory that I wanted to conquer with a definition of success was to live like a local. I feel like I've had that to an extent, but Colorado is beginning to feel like laying on my back for too long. I just need to change positions.

As I grow up, I'm less inclined to do extreme sports; snowboarding, camping, or climbing. However, there still remains a need to experience a change of scenery. A day at the beach. A weekend lake house, or simply time with family. What we have here is mountains. While we are taking minimal advantage of them, I feel like I have received my fair share of them.

The combination of little career success, missing family, and inability to experience a variety of terrain has me wondering if we are primed for a move.

Is Greenville, SC what we have been waiting for? A place that will have family, be close to other family, have access to beach, mountains, lake.

I am of the current opinion that I need to continue maintaining my family life and continue to write quality software.

The Lord knows and I have learned many things of Him and myself in these failures and setbacks that I wouldn't have learned otherwise.

_The Lord is my Shepherd. He leads me beside still waters._
