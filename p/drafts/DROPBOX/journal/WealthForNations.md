# Wealth for the Nations

_2/28/07_

I've been having some 2nd thoughts about the necessity of acquiring wealth. My initial mentality has been that I can only give what I have. I want to help poor and needy people, but how can I help them if I'm poor and needy myself? It has made sense to me for the longest time that I need to acquire what "we" don't have and then I can share it.

A couple problems with that thinking. One is I notice the more I discover that wealth is hard to come by, the more I also realize that I could never make enough to really give out to others. I mean, how much would $1, $5, $10 million do anyway?

I'm beginning to think that what I do is whatever God wants me to do. If He wants me to start a program or volunteer, I can do that. If He wants me apart of a big charity, He'll bring the funding.

Being a faithful and wise steward doesn't mean that I am taking on the pressures of God. It means I am faithful to whatever and however He wants me to participate.
