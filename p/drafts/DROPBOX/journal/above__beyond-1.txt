Above &amp; Beyond
==============

While in Naples for christmas, Shawn Mahan came over and we spent the
day together. First time in 3 years seeing one another.
We caught up about several deep topics and then began to get into AB.
I heard his passion about the topic, but as I began to dig deep about
the issues, authority, vision, and resources, it became pretty clear
from my perspective that he had a mess on his hands. With 3 different
leaders, and 5 different departments all calling themselves AB made
the whole topic that much more confusing.

On top of that, for the first time I realized that I'm no so sure I
see that ministry mentality anymore. While I see that activities are
cleaver and help draw a crowd, I don't know if I like the menality
that those things are essential. It's weird. I'm finding that I would
want to gather, but for Christ, His life, and revealing Him. If the
activities were brought in for "balance" and refreshment, then I
agree. But not as a vital tool for people to hear the gospel.

It may sound like I'm splitting hairs, but it's the heart that
matters. I will be sensitive in passing judgement, so much so that I'm
going to still progress forward with Shawn if he still finds passion
and desire to move fwd.
