I’ve worked in a variety of companies now. Some that generate 500k, $1m, 20M, and some that generate $1B in sales.

There’s a facet to the job market that makes people think like hiring people is a once sided deal. When in fact the best co-workers have a variety of skills they were not also hired for.

These are activities you would have to do if you were in a startup and would be more than happy to do them. You have been paid or maybe not, but you’ve logged at least 100 hours in personal time working on them.
