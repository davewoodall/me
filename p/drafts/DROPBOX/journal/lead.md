# "But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law"
- Gal 5:18

_3/13/8_


The concept of doing christian works is rooted in an ambition to please God. We want to be a faithful steward of His grace and love. But we learn that is actually a youthful view of the faith. For we discover sooner or later that we can not live like Christ. Only Christ in us can live His life.

You are beginning to experience freedom by realizing that Christ in you leads you and has accomplished all that's needed to achieve by living by the law, we can start to live without the law in mind. It takes some time though b/c as a young and growing believer, it seems we must walk through the season of 'trying' to be a christian. Depending on how deep you get in that legalism probably affects how much you can detach yourself from it and reconnect to Christ in you.
Along the way there comes a point when you begin to recognize God's Spirit speaking to you. It's almost to good to be true because it's much more natural than initially imagined. Much more internal than the natural man could anticipate.
Who's to say that God is not the one giving you the adventurous idea that makes you come alive? Young believers tend to fret that they cannot love what they're doing and be pleasing God at the same time. Is it not possible that He is the one who birthed the internal love and passion you take credit for?
However you define it, scripture teaches that in Christ, you are not under the law. The spirit is not another law, but a Life. A life with empowering freedom. Fretting if your definition of freedom is right is still 'law living' just go out and live with an awareness that it is Christ who set you free. He will continue to guide you in your growth and His revelation of Himself.
