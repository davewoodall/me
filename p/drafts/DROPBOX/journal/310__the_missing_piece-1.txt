3/10 - The missing piece?
=========================

Spoke with Hayes yesterday about starting a business.
We were talking and how I would want to be apart of anything that
could be successful. I feel like there is some kind of barrier that I
can't seem to overcome. Is it me or the Lord? I suppose I believe that
if the Lord wanted me to have connected He would make it so.
I am looking for:
1. Money to fund my venture
2. A product that would find money
3. A team that I could create the synergy with
4. Understanding of how to put it all together...

What is it that I'm missing?

I can't help but think that my craft is in apparel and that it could
be my ticket. But when I look at what that means for work, I'm not so
sure I know what my options are. I've wanted to work with apparel
companies in the past but haven't found one that is willing or the
connection to jump futura.

What is up with the design studio?
