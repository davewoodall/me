# psalm 90:10

_12/17/07_

>_The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off and we fly away._

Life is an amazing gift. An opportunity to discover that we have _ZERO_ power. We have no strength or Life but what we have been entrusted by God.
The mentality about life I'm beginning to feel under this new revelation is that this life on earth is like Christmas Eve. It has it's parties, festivities, and experiences, but it's not the main event.
The opportunities in this life are merely preparation and temporarily placed for the formation of Christ in us.

Regardless of what I do, Lord willing, I will live 80+/- years then go to be with the Lord. He spent 7 days on this place and I want to experience it and all it's nuances. I want to contribute holiness, life, and righteousness to this earth before I go to be with the LORD.

One, of many, points to discover is that Life is filled with assets and events that we should experience, not possess. We take nothing with us.
_Lord would you allow me to experience the Fullness of Christ at a Kings Ransom. I want to see Christ move in and around me in such monstrous ways that I can only glorify God._

>_And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us, and establish Thou the work of our hands for us--yea, the work of our hands, establish Thou it._ v.17

The foundation begins in my mind as the following:
# Eternity is real.
# I am not God.
# God wants to be glorified through me.
# Know thy Time.
# Know thy Tasks.
# Know thy relationships.
# Know thy finances.
# Experience, don't possess
# Wisdom is in the simple as much as the sensational
# Dare to dream and think BIG!
