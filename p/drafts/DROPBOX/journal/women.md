# women

God made Man, then He said "I can make humans better. So Version 2 is an upgrade"

husbands love your wives - (because you're going to get annoyed when they know more than you and you don't like it, because you're proud)
Wives respect your husbands - (Because they are not as smart as you and you're going to get annoyed that you have to obey them, because you're proud)

men - cd player
women - ipod

men - rgb
women - rainbow

women - create attraction
women - attracted to a man who is alive and self aware, not selfish
men - become attractive when they become more 'women' like
men - attracted to meat

pride prevents harmony between the two

men think attraction is related to money, power, muscles
women are attracted to the more advanced needs
if a woman's inside is fulfilled, the outside doesn't matter
men don't really have that 'inside' so their 'inside' is shallow
our depth is - hey, i got you this house, what more do you want!

women - grow a baby 270 days * 24 hours * 60 min * 60 sec
women - feed a baby
men - show up for 20 seconds, or 000008% of the contribution.

women - mother w/ patience
women - protect their own
women - care for the poor

In realizing that I am not the superior species has helped me swallow my pride, serve, and submit to the wisdom of my wife.

Men have muscles - to lift heavy objects
Men have minds - to build the rooms for the women to live in
