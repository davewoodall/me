## 7. God is already everywhere.
We're not taking Jesus anywhere He isn't already present. Psalm 139 confirms there is nowhere we can go that God is not. Why are churches sending missionaries? Is it because the people want to go or because the church thinks it's their responsibility and duty to bring Jesus to other parts of the World?
