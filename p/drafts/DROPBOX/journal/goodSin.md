# The good news about sin

_2007?_


So I feel I've always thought of Jesus's dying as preventing me from going to hell but when I see that those other things are really other forms of sin, then I can say that he took those too and I, again recognize, that I have no power to save myself from those things, but by Faith Believe He can.
