We've continued [coffee talk](http://dave.woodalls.me/coffee-talk) for nearly 8 months now. In that time, I've noticed the relational dynamics fall into three categories. The relationship of Paul, Barnabas, and Timothy make for a good diagram of the 3 relational dynamics that make for a healthy life. I prefer to use a real relational rather than titles of nameless people...

## Barney (The Peer)
We started meeting because we are in the same season of life. We've done well to share tips, stories, and encouraging as we all work through marriage, family, careers, and personal growth. Peers sets your bearings knowing you are not alone as you figure out life together.

_When you are a Barny, your responsibility it so dialog_

--
As we've continued, it's become clear that we each have our own strengths.

## Paul (The Mentor)
A mentor is someone with experience willing to share. They know more than the other's.
As a mentor, your charge is to freely share insight that you have with those seeking you out.

_When you are a paul, your responsibility it so tell_

## Tim (The Mentee)
To be a Timothy, means to be stretched beyond your knowledge and current comfort zone. Your job is to seek out and find the answers through people who know them. A timothy takes on a posture of humility, and service toward Paul. Not in inferiority, but in recognition that you need Paul more than he needs you. You want to make sure your ignorance is not accompanied by being unpleasant to be around.
Someone to pour into

_When you are a timothy, your responsibility it so ask._

By order of interest and time, we all posses each of these roles.
