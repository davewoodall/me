I started meeting with three other dads for an hour over coffee, for 6 weeks. I've discovered that our conversations drift along four depths that fit nicely into four P's.

### Polite
Talks about the weather, sports, and anything agreeable.

### Practical
Tips on programming, family hikes, and preparation for economic collapse.

### Personal
Employment, marriage, or other topics that relate specific to the individual.

## Paradigm
Religion, evolution, politics, and other big picture views that influence how we live life.


We meet at 6am, so there's little time spent on polite topics since that would not really justify early rising. While paradigm can be discussed at personal, or practical levels. The notion of conversing to influence one's paradigm seems to be a deeper, longer discussion than our hour. So far, practical and personal topics have been a nice medium for the group.
