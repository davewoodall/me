# The forest
I think community has forgotten it's role. Sabbath is for the man, not man for the sabbath. A room full of strangers is not community. What you need to do is know and be known of the people you encounter. A room full of people at Target is not community. Nether is a room full of people in the church auditorium. Just because people are gathering doesn't mean it's community. Community should not be a forest, but a gathering of specific trees.

# Tow in surfing
Tow in surfing is where one person wants to do something that is beyond his own ability. This means two things. One that you have a specific target you were made, or want to do. And that you have people around you that can help you do it.

## What is your wave?
What do you want to do in life? What are you called to do? Can you define it. I think people try by making empty mission statement documents trying to outline an ideal self that they want to live up to. I'm not describing that. I'm talking about taking time to take inventory of who you are and how you are wired.

## What is your jet ski?
Not that you are looking for things to do, but have you been able to define and articulate how you can help other people? What are your strengths and passions that you would be more than happy to help people with?

## Finite time
Unfortunately, there is only one savior and you are not it. You cannot help everyone that comes along the way. Steve Covey's 7 habits introduced the ideas to me first that there is a circle of influence and a circle of awareness.

What I want a community to help me accomplish is removing the yeast of my life.

Imagine that you have $100 to spend and you can spend it however you want. You can purchase 100, $1 items, 10, $10 items, or 1, $100 item. It's a question of quality vs. quantity. I am of the opinion that you can begin to see your life as someone who has one or two things to offer people. What is your gift in life?

I know I would benefit more if you were unified in your mind and stance toward something specific that God made you to do and be. I am not the point of you living your life so what you have to offer may or not be of value to me, but since God made you that way, you will benefit some people.

## Forget the African
There are so many scenarios that people consume their time and energy with that are counter productive. Seemily good, philosophical questions about what we should be doing about the African, or the neighbors, or when someone asks for help.

Debate is not a characteristic of Christianity. EIther you do or don't. Either these scenarios are part of your real world and you're helping and involved with them or you're not.

## My part
I want to come into community with a transparent view of who I am, how I can help, and what I need help with. I also want to come into community knowing that I am not my kids, or my marriage. While those two are vital parts of being a man, they are not what I was made for.

They are of utmost, priceless value, but they are not why God made me. Part of discovering who I am is learning why I was made and how I can help and serve others.

It's easy to get into debate and say 'What about the woman who helped Elisha with what little she had, dont you think we should be of the same mind?'. I say, let's not look at stories to dictate who God made you to be. Jesus had all the answers in the world for widows and orphans, but he passed right by them for 30 years to go make funiture.

My point is let's turn within to listen to the voice of the Spirit. Let's look at who you are and take inventory of what gets you passionate and what loses energy. Let's become surrounded and transparent with men who you know and know you. That you can trust they are seeking the Lord with you.

Let's aim to acquire all that we can of our individual relationship with the Lord first, then see how that is manifested in the lives of others.

## What it is
Community is for you to receive the gifts of others and also use your gifts for others.

## The larger forest
When Olivia passed away we received inquiries of nearly 100 different people asking how they can help out. That is a component of the larger Body of Christ, and the genuine ability of God to provide all your needs. Those strangers were not looking to become friends in the moment, but to serve as the need arose.

We are the same that we all are available as we take on the form of a servant. But, we are all unique servants. We have different resources, talents, contacts and how we used them.
