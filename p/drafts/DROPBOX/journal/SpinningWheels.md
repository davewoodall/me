# Spinning Wheels

_2/22/07_

I watched the television while I was changing at the YMCA. A JEEP sponsored mountain bike race was happening and at that moment they brought up the marketing director for an interview. He was in his 40s. I instantly imagined what that guys life has been to reach that moment. I knew I could put on that event. And I imagine he knew he could too at my age. I concluded that position is a combination of skills and timing.

While watching the adults race on the TV conducive track, it hit me that I was watching my peers play. Sure its to sell more JEEPS, but in the context of a playful lifestyle. The fans, employees, and athletes had their minds on fun and games. Not products. (Which is why event sponsorship is an effective way to get in with your target audience.) I realized that I can have my pick. I can work for pay or I can work for play. And so can everyone else. People get what they want. They may not get everything they want, but they get what they choose.

The Moral: TV is good for you.

Guard your heart. For out of it are the issues of life. Proverb 4:23
