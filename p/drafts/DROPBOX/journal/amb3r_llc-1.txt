AMB3R, LLC
==========

We did it. We formed an LLC.
For some reason though it felt more like the obvious next step instead
of this ceremonial thing.

I also don't know how long or how well it would work, but I think
we're going about the establishment the right way.

The circumstances I feel that lead up to this point include:

  * Jon's lack of leadership
  * Futura's hollow and ineffective staff
  * Losing business by poor production management
  * My lack of solid compensation
  * A need to make some additional income
  * Having access to a niche production service.

We're still hashing out the launch scenarios, But my prayer is that
the Lord would establish us. Give us clarity of thought, Prepare the
way for us to transition into our own company, prevent us from going
into debt, be able to balance school, work, and homelife.

I'm flying down 5/1 for 2 days to get things more setup. I hope we
will be totally setup by 6/1.
