Compensation discussion From Ouray
==================================

Dave,

I would like to discuss with you before you make any final decisions
to make sure there aren’t any miscommunications. Let me know if
you want me to call you this evening, weekend or wait until Monday
after you have spoken with your wife. Here are some of the terms that
I would propose putting into an offer letter if we get to that point.
The biggest change is a $5,000 “signing/tuition bonus” to
help offset some school expenses and tuition:

“Signing/Tuition bonus”: $5,000 paid directly to you on
your start date.
Base pay: $75,000 paid in 26 increments of $2,884.62
Minimum bonus: $11,250 based on goals that you and I set together. I
am extremely confident you will not have a problem achieving these and
although it is not my preference, we can develop the goals together
immediately if you have concerns.
Cell phone expense: $1,200 expensed at a rate of $100 per month
Stock appreciation plan: We are finalizing the legal work but we plan
to have a definitive agreement in front of the executives that qualify
(including you) by the end of Q2:2009. Your initial allocation is
expected to be worth a multiple of six-figures upon a liquidity event.
Benefits: Participation in current employee benefits program and any
changes made for top-level executives will apply to you.

By my math, that equates to a minimum, hard compensation for the first
twelve months of $92,450. This does not include benefits or the stock
appreciation plan. I’m sorry we cannot further bridge the gap to
your preferred $100,000 compensation number in the first year. Jon and
I are incredibly excited to have an opportunity to work with you. We
strongly feel the operational foundation of the company is built and
the vision/strategy that you develop will immediately show results and
drive the company forward. One other thing that I forgot to mention,
if we come to an agreement, I would love to get you out to the CAMEX
show in Anaheim, CA on March 14 for a couple of days. It is the number
one tradeshow that we support. All of our college reps will be there
and it will give you a chance to visit some of our competitors and get
a good sense for what is going on in the collegiate market. I realize
that is right after final exams so maybe you could take a couple of
days off after the tradeshow before coming into the office.

Let me know when you would like to discuss.

Best regards,

Ryan
