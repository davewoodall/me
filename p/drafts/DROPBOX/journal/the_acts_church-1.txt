The acts church
===============

How often is a new church or one that is attempting to grow or change
their culture, do they use ‘the early church’ as a model? They explain
what they did and how they acted and they ask us to do the same thing.

There are a few issues I have with that.
First the early acts church, the one that pastors are teaching from,
was still performing as under the previous dispensation.

Second, by looking back and looking for a standard, we turn ourselves
back into the very thing that we’re saying to stop. Adding a soft law
to our lives.
God is alive and well inside us and is more than excited to do
something unique in you and your church experience.
