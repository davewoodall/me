# 2014 year in review

## Self Assetment

### 1. What 3-5 strengths did you demonstrate in 2014? Please list any notable accomplishments that had an impact on the organization and/or team.


1. Leadership
Last year, Doug challenged the Consumer team to use Angular. I knew a few co-workers who wanted to learn but there was no formal process for us to collaborate. I took the initiative and started the Angular code club. I’ve learned Angular and helped others learn Angular. It’s also been a great way to meet co-workers who I wouldn’t otherwise interact with. Additionally, David Bock recently shared that the model has been replicated with two other clubs; Clojure club and an Open Source Club.


2. Loyalty
I’m committed to making LS a great company and great place to work. The following are 3 examples of activities I wasn’t hired for but how I pitched in; 

I. New Employee Onboarding
After my first few months at LS, Sara Flemming requested help improving new developers ramp-up. We met a few times and started a culture document. It’s an ongoing discussion that I am still apart of. 

II. Communication
As a former graphic designer, art director, and entrepreneur I noticed a few areas of disconnect between artists and programmers. I coordinated a few meetings between Will Harding, Doug Ramsey, and myself to discuss how to improve communication between art, business, and code. Even though Will has moved on, Doug and I have expressed interest to continue sometime in 2015. 

III. Alignment
The Angular club’s mission was to learn Angular. We’ve been doing so by hacking on various simple projects. At end of 2014 I was approached to see if the club could help with an internal project. Specifically, a skills sharing directory. The skills directory would be used to align the right person for the job. After meeting with David Bock, I’ve taken a mini-PM role in organizing what’s needed to help build a tool that LS would benefit from. 

3. Attitude
In my 1st year at LS, I’ve been apart of several different projects including: Escapes, Daily Gem, Personalization, and now Save For Later. My current level of experience is considered ‘junior’ and my training is a more formal Rails “CRUD” so that these topics have been new territory for me. At times my comprehension has been slow to grasp the topics at hand but that is not due to lack of interest. I am excited about what I’m working on and enjoy how much it stretches me. :-)


### 2. What could you have done differently to have boosted your performance in 2014?

Most of my experience before LivingSocial was Freelance. So, much of my learning was self-guided. It took my some time to fully realize how available my co-workers were to help. In hindsight, I should have reached out to my coworkers sooner. There is a genuine collaborative culture at LivingSocial that I can benefit greatly from.


### 3. List 3-5 skills that you would like to enhance or develop in 2015. What projects or experiences could you take on to develop those skills?

1. Fundamentals
I want to continue my focus on Ruby and JavaScript fundamentals and how they are used in such a large scale environment. Such as how JavaScript uses modules, or Presenters in Ruby. I would be interested in formalizing those discussions by starting a ‘js-triva’ and ‘ruby-trivia’ breakout for 15m a week to talk about granular methods, quirks, and aspects of each language with co-workers. Improving basics would enable us to write cleaner, more efficient code and focus on business needs rather than pondering implemention. Additionally, interactive environments like this are good for remote employee morale.

2. Code Craftsmanship 
LivingSocial’s large scale architecture is impressive and something I want to continue to understand. I hope to spend time in 2015 engaging in discussions around PR’s and make sure I understand the bigger picture of the code. I’ve already done this some with meetings with Tom Copeland and it’s been very beneficial. I hope to continue working with him to refactor confusing tests and code. This would benefit LivingSocial by  keeping the code base clean for future features while minimizing the time it takes to track down unforeseen bugs.

3. Monitoring
One of my goals is summarized as “spotting problems before customers do”. I’m interested in understanding what metrics we use and why. 

## Hassler

### 1. List 3-5 ways your manager supported you this year. What role did your manager play in enabling your key accomplishments?

Hey Doug, 

I’ve really enjoyed working with Dave. His willingness to take time to train me has been key to my ramping up. Dave has provided guidance and the proper amount of context for me to contribute. He has also taken the time to get to know me and how I best work. The result has been giving me the kind of room for healthy trial and error. 

I’ve enjoyed leaning on Dave’s extensive programming background to discover vital secondary tools like vim, bash, and unix processes. These topics have come about when there were errors with my development environment or other mysterious bugs. Dave has not only helped in those areas but also taught me about them. I have worked with few people as knowledgeable as Dave.

Aside from professional help, Dave has been a good friend. As you know, my family experienced a tragedy this year and Dave’s willingness to help and speak in context what life’s priorities has given me a great deal of respect for him and trust for his leadership.

I really can’t think of a better fit of a manager for who I am and where I’m at in my career.


### 2. What could your manager do to better support you next year?

Learning and competency are big for this job and naturally align with my temperament. I recently limited the number of outside tutorials in order to spend more time in the LS code base and use it to drive my learning. As such, questions arise on a broader scale like wondering why something is a certain way in addition to wondering what something is.

Dave’s experience and temperament tend to be very direct to solve the problem then wanting to move on quickly to the next task. I would like to occasionally request an expanded discussion about the task we are working on (or just finished) and ask questions that, while in direction of a Jira story, might not directly pertain to the story itself. I think there is value in the moment. Another difference is that I’m a visual learner. I benefit greatly from diagrams - uml, sequence, etc. to learn. I would love to spend some time around a whiteboard from time to time. 

Lastly, Dave and my relationship is honest and transparent. We’ve discussed these things over our last few 1:1 and I believe have come to better understand one another and how to help one other do better in 2015.

Thanks!
