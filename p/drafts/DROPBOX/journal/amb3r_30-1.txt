AMB3R 3.0
=========

We are in a new place! 4 houses up - moved from a 600 sq foot place to
a 1,400 sq foot place!
I'm having trouble writing it. Even more so understanding what it
means. Simply the fact that we've moved into a new place leaves both
Jeremy and I still in a state of wonder and shock.

Considering the larger economic environment in which we are working we
are just surprised that we still have as much business as we do.
Granted, it's the summer season but there is talk of some tees for the
Fall..

I am truly humbled to have experienced this up to this point and
recognize that it is the Lord who has established this business. He
has brought us this far. I take no credit for the idea, establishment,
or growth of this company. You oh Lord are merciful and gracious to
Jeremy and me!

Lord, I surrender this next step with this company. It is not mine and
I don't want to ever hold it like it is. I want to experience the
revelation and formation of Christ in me through this business..

I wonder if this is a new mission internally for us. That we use this
environment of service and growth as a key indicator of discipleship
and personal spiritual growth.

Lord, at Your mercy we lay down the establishment, effectiveness,
efficiency, equity, growth, and development of this company. We are
AMBASSADORS for Christ in the turbulent world.
