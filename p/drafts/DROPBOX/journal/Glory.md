@cris,

Ok, then Let's talk Africa and Noah on another thread...

One cannot achieve greatness without the building blocks of tenacity, determination, resolve, sacrifice, vision, commitment, comprehension, competency, clarity of mind, capacity, creativity, and other requirements to piece together complex puzzles.

I can credit those to myself as much as I can credit myself for getting oxygen to my blood, and blood to my brain.
These valuable attributes are glories that enable man to be great. They are gifts from God and reflections of Him.

Some have more than others. We are simply called to use what we have, wisely.

We who  and we participate with him.

 that produce whatever man uses them for.

How does the brain retain knowledge? How does oxygen get into blood? How do blood cells provide oxygen to the brain? How does the miracle of learning happen without our effort?

Using the tools we are given is only a part of the play. Some get more tools than others. Those who use them wisely are called wise stewards.
