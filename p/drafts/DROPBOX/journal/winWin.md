# When not to think win/win?

_8/7/8_

I've been working on a tee project of 4,000 tees for north point. The day they were due, we were notified they had gone missing. I am sitting here, 8 days later with still no shirts.

We contacted a broker (Koch) who then contacted a shipper(Yellow). Up until yesterday I wasn't holding Koch responsible since they are just the broker.
There was a point of clarity though that was birthed in the urgency. I explained to Karl the COO of Koch that Yellow had no incentive to look for these tees and that was unacceptable.

NP came up with a short term solution of giving out temporary tees that say "volunteer" until these tees are found.

I told Koch we needed them to consider picking up the tab and then going after Yellow to hold them responsible. They agreed to do that and pay for 4,000 reprint temporary tees.

I feel like I've learned so much in this process and I just wanted to try to document it.

A verification of how their business works when things go bad - what is their policy to fix things if they don't do what they say they'll do.

I called on their nature of business, doing the right thing for the customer, working with incentive instead of against it.

One thing that I feel I'm starting to pick up about how my clients do business and how different I do is this concept of win/win. I have had a definition of someone who should win when they do something bad. How we both can come out on top. I'm trying to process this new angle I took with Koch for them to pick up a $10,000+ tab.


It's been a crazy week when you combine this with Oscar being born and dealing with the robbery.
