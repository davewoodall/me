# Being a Code Columbo

Dave hoover gave a talk trying to gracefully provide a progress chart for us non-develoepers to get some bearings. He decided to use the alaphabet as a scale. Z, being a letter no one ever gets to. But that there are plenty of People way down there, near Z.

3 years in, I'd put myself at around a "D". I'm the low-man on the totem pole at Living Social. Being here, here's how I'm aspiring to contribute at LivingSocial, or getting into "E" Status.

# Set the stage.
As a new developer on a massive code base, I'm being handed stories that I'm clueless on. The goal is not to ship them

As a sales rep, the goal is not so much to see dollars, but to see the activity they are producing before they get there. It's a clouds before rain kind of situation.

With beginning a new coding job, it's very similar. Instead of delivering sales, you're to deliver storeies. However, there's a learning curve.

The code base is hard to understand. It's like being handed a 5,000 page book and being told to know where and how to edit it.

The best thing to do is have courage, determination, and continue to flash a light on the particular code in question.

While you're there, you are showing signs if you can reflect back what you see. It helps them see what you see and reflect back to you with questions like;

- is this how these two apps talk to each other?
- where does this information come from?
- what is using thrift

You have to be more of a detetctive and recognize that you are like columbo and your co workers are the suspects in question about the code base.

Some sluthe tricks to help you formulate questions;

- who's responsible for this?
- break it
- pry it
- branch it
- blame it
- distort it
- delete it
- ask it (console)
- benchmark it
