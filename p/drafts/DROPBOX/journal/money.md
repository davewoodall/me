# Thoughts on Money
_1/26/14_

Feels like i'm in a new country and i'm not fluent. So, I'm spending my time trying to be available to talk the languages in order to make a contribution.

I don't like the logic that says;

I need to make more money to stabilize my family. Then, once I have enough money, I can start helping other people out.

Lord, You are mighty beyond words. You don't need me to make money for any reason. You provide all my needs and the needs of others.

What then am I called to do. At 6am this morning, I went outside to marvel at the stars, the work of your hands. I want to simply participate in what You would have me. I am so weak and avoid conflict in pursuit of comfort. But You, OH LORD are reality, peace, and who I was made for.

I asked Danae what 2014 would look like if we didn't think of reality and I agreed with her list. They are all material things we have lived without for 10 years. We have lived with a combination of our pre-marriage life or simple hodge podge things. While stuff is not the point. Here were the things we both felt we would want to acquire;

- New Car
- New Wardrobe
- Vacation in the Cabin
- Camp
- Purchase outdoor equipment
- Purchase items for boys school and play
- Pay off debts

While I would totally agree on those things, I assume that we will (or won't) have them at the granting of the Lord. But then my mind goes to this next place.

What has the Lord called me to do? I am so appreciative of the good life we are living, but I cannot accept so easily (yet) that my life is a perpetual vacation while so many people are suffering in so many different ways. Lord, correct my thoughts and actions in Your perfect time. I want to help however I can proclaim the gospel to my family friends, neighbors and world.
