I was Christmas Shopping with Danae for the nephews in the toy section of Target when I first had this strange experience where I felt I could tell the heart of this young goth girl who walked past me.  She was about 14 with dyed black hair, semi-goth clothing, painted nails, and tacky makeup.
The closest thing I can associate the sensation with is that scene in "unbreakable":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbreakable_%28film%29 where the hero knows what's going on with the people he encountered.

I think the clarity of that moment can be attributed to accepting the truth that we are vessels and reflect the glory of the _"Life"_ inside us. And if there is in fact life, there is no need to cover. 
Like cold, which is a lack of heat. Darkness is a lack of light, or life.

Combine that revelation with the truth that people's natural tendency is to provide layers of protection, they don't realize they are just like the osterage that believes they are hidden b/c their heads are. (my thoughts after reading "encouragement":http://www.amazon.com/Encouragement-Caring-Dr-Larry-Crabb/dp/0310225914)

They genuinely believe they are covering so much so they'll even lie to themselves than tell people the truth about themselves. Our ignorance has us believe or accept their surface answer that their makeup, music, lyrics, drawings, friends, or actions are all in good fun and don't mean anything. When in fact they do. Everything we do is birthed from an internal place. If you don't have that internally, you can't have it externally.

Scripture even tells us that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. That truth is becoming even more alive.

_Lord, may I glorify you in my short time on earth. May I live unto Your will. I would ask that you would continue to develop this discernment that I may speak to the heart of Your children words of love, life, encouragement, and peace. May my words speak of eternity in the simple, uncommon ways._
