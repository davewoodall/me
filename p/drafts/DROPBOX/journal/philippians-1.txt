Philippians
===========

“For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the Spirit, and
rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.” 2:3

Paul points out a big deal here saying that a formally crucial action
is no longer necessary. That the point of that service was to
demonstrate a heart unto God. But now, in Christ, we don’t need that
act to demonstrate righteousness b/c righteousness comes only by the
Spirit inside us.
Which leads me to ask this:
1st, Holiness required an animal sacrifice
Then, Holiness required circumcision
Then, holiness required baptism.

In Christ though, don’t we receive these things just by His Spirit? I
wonder if many churches baptize just to ‘be sure’ kind of to do a
safety net. However, I’m also wondering if this would then be the ‘a
little leaven leaven the whole lump’ kind of situation.

Having no confidence in the flesh is a realization that we are
dependent on Christ to make us pure and righteous not any single deed.
