I can't believe I haven't written in over 3 weeks! well... I suppose I
can now that I think of it. This month has been crazy and maybe part
of it has to do with the idea here... that I'm not taking time out to
be still and know He is LORD.

I am having trouble finding peace in any area of my life. My home
finances, Work Finances, work systems and responsibilities, and
personal health are all under attack. Over the last few days though,
I've been thinking about this world and the next and what my
experience on this one is supposed to be and look like. I find that I
have little tribulations like the ones previous christians had to
encounter.

Lord, I surrender my life unto Your will, Spirit, and Glory. I am
young and immature. I find this world to be a perfect place for You to
develop me and purge the non-Christ in me. My flesh is weak and unable
to do the things that my Spirit knows are real and true. It is by You
alone can I accomplish the things that have been revealed inside. I
ask for strength for today. Mercy for today. Healing and righteousness
for today. Love for today. selflesness for today. May I turn the other
cheek and love those who persecute me. Not me but Christ alive and
well in me. You are invited in and I accept that You gladly accept.
