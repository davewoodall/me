Springs of Life
===============

>_"All my springs are in Thee"_ Psalm 87:7

You are my Life.
You are my Strength.
You are the source of my existence.
These are truths far to deep for me.

I need You to show up for my survival. I have no strength, capability,
or options if You don't look on me.

>_Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
holiness in the fear of God._ II Cor 7:1

I believe that this really means;
let us allow God to cleanse us from all filthiness of the flesh and
spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
Because all of scripture points to our inability to do this. If we
could in our own strength and power cleanse ourselves, then we
wouldn't need Christ or His power to save us.

So looking at it from that perspective, I can recognize that Christ
wants to enter and establish Himself invisibly and visibly. The Spirit
in me agrees with His desires. We are in common for the outcome. I
must attribute that too to Christ laying the desire in my heart as _
it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good
pleasure_ Phil. 2:13 (nasb)

If I think about it, the process is `slower' than I wish. Or maybe
it's like that scene in the Matrix in the end where Neo is watching
the punches come at him in slow motion, which enables him to overcome.
I wonder if life has a sense of slow motion that enables us to
accomplish a many great things.

Lord I want you to cleanse me from all filthiness of body, soul, and
mind. Would you clear me out that I disappear and that You alone are
glorified.
