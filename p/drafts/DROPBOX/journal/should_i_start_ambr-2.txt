Should I start AMB*R?
=====================

I sitting here wondering if I should dive into this design stuiod 100%
and ask jon if he would go in with me to start my own thing.
What if I gave it 2008 and push my DU entrance to spring 2009 and if
this studio fails... I can go to school and then become a CPA on Marco
Island.

I just discovered that AMB3R.com is available...
