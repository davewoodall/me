## The paper

The Mitchell's subscribed to the local paper but Tom wasn't going to wait until morning to begin his treasure hunt.  

Chanting "Daily racing form. Daily racing form. Daily racing form." so not to forget what he just heard. What made those forms so valuable? 

On his bike home he passed a gas station. His enthusiastic entrance implied it was his first time in a convenience store. He made a bee line for the newspapers. 
	
	Tom: "This newspaper is old. Can I have it?"  
	Clerk: "Sure." 

The outside trash bin made became a desk. Who knew the paper was a secret treasure map. If a drunk man could decifer it, Tom knew he could. 

Gotta be in sports. He tossed the rest in the trash. Tom didn't know what he was looking for so he missed it at first. 
They were small and poorly formatted on the back of the sports section so he mistook them for legal jargon. This is probably a way to whittle out some treasure hunters. 

He read a few lines and stopped. His brow furrowed. 'What am I even looking atâ€¦' He mumbled to himself. The stats read like the stats from the financial section. He was both curious and annoyed that it wasn't as easy as the drunk boasted.
