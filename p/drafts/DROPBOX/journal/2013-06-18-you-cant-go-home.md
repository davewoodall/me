I have friends who say, _well, if things were to get real bad, I'll just go back and live with my family back in (far away state) until things clear over_.

First, that assumes you'll have the ability to relocate from across the country while things are going crazy. The second assumption is that once you get there, your family has taken the time to build a nice stock pile for you.

It's time to cut the umbilical cord and begin to build a fake farm for 1 - 3 weeks.

Then, see how things are going and if you really can uproot your family.
