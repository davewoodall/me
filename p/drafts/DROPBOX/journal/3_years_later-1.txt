3 years later...
================

>_And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us, And establish the
work of our hands for us; Yes, establish the work of our hands._

3 years ago I highlighted that verse just as I was beginning my
journey with Futura and Nashville. It's been an interesting 3 years.

Danae and I have spent 98% of it together and have become one
another's best friends.

I think I worked hard with Futura, but in the dark. It never felt that
way, but I was scrambling at how to `win' the game. However, had I
figured out how to make the cash, I don't know if I would have been as
motivated about all the things that I am currently.

I am so excited about CO and making the transition. I never seemed to
have people here to help plug me in which made it so difficult.

I also can't believe how much business I was given from Passion, North
Point, and Bigstuf. While I lost BS this year, The Lord has still kept
us and permitted us to pay down some debts.

So 3 years later, I want to pray that prayer again.
Father, would your hand and spirit lay upon us, and establish the work
of our hands. Would you pave the way for the transition, school, and
our future. We love you as our God and know you hear our prayers. Lead
us in Your ways of righteousness, holiness, wisdom, and truth. Set us
on a Rock that is higher than we could ever climb. Let us be so
blessed as to see the revelation of Christ in and around us. May you
be Glorified in all we say, think, and do.
