### Knowing You
Lord, I want to know You. I am not here for my interests, glory, kingdom, or comfort. 

My spirit is real. And it is alive by a Presence and Entity that is not me. However, that is the most real and eternal part of me. The part that is me and the Holy Spirit - united.

### Me
Learning computers the way that I am feels in many ways like a waste of time. However, that is why I think You are using it. Because I have to trust You during this season that is changing my skill set, at the very least. 

I want to live one day at a time, walking with You step by step.
