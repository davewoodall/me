Jimmy,

I love and respect you and wanted you to know why I have been hard to reach.

The loss of Olivia is impacting me more now than when it happened 7 months ago. Losing a child is hard to explain as well as process.

As such, it leaves me with limited capacity and have withdrawn from nearly all relationships and activities. This is not a request for attention and I anticipate this will continue for at least another year.  

I recognize this is awkward and I am sincerely sorry if this offends you.
