====================

"To walk in newness of life."

2 Cor 3:16-18
See that a change has happened
a. acknowledge the old and it's phases and shortcomings
b. explain the purpose from a bigger point of view that it's to
demonstrate we are powerless in our selves

1 cor 2
There is a greater plan that is not on the heart's intuition. This new
plan requires a death to ones `sense' and a recognition that that is
part of the old life. (Rom 2:15 - the law is on the heart)

Galatians 3:13 - 4:19
The law was important at the time, but now there is a higher law that
is being formed in us. The more you allow Christ to live, the more
this new `law' will take hold on you and you will see that this is
more `common sense' to LIFE than the Law was. For there is now `LIFE'
when you are constantly measuring yourself against a standard. The
point is LIFE... does this make sense? It's finding pleasure in the
moments.
My brother and I talk about how when we used to smoke pot and that it
so consumed our minds that nothing else had pleasure unless we were
high. It was such a untra-sensation it numbed all other pleasures. Let
the Life of God bring you back to a point where you become aware of
the pleaures of living.

Gal 5:1-9
You cannot live under the Law and the Spirit. the "line" to do both,
is still on the side of teh Law. There is no line to balance, think of
it more like a ledge. You either are on the ledge or you have stepped
off.
This is the oxymoron to live in meritable grace. you can't live in
both

Gal 5:14 - 26
The very thing the heart's objective was to be righteous had different
movtives but the `fruit' of living by the law would be a righteous
life. We can safely assume that people feel that righteous people are
also kind, loving, and considerate.
The very things that we expect to achieve from the law are in fact the
fruits of walking with the spirit.

Col 1:26&27
There is a prayer we pray asking Jesus into our hearts. But while we
remember that, we must think it is symbolic. But the reality is He is
the one who made us. We need to realize that the Spirit inside us is
alive and well.
