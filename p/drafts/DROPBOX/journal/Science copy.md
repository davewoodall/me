"The trustworthiness of God's behavior in His world is the foundation of all scientific truth. Upon it the scientist rests his faith and from there he goes on to achieve great and useful things in such fields as those of navigation, chemistry, agriculture, and the medical arts." - Tozer. "Knowledge of the Holy" pg. 66

When I hear these things I wish I knew a way to learn and understand the science of this world to worship and be in awe. Learning the mechanics is learning the integrity of God. I'm not looking for career information but a guide into how each topic points to God.

I wonder if it's part of the deception that has man initially bored with all things fascinating. Faith and life would explode by expanding man's vision to see God in all His commonalities.

"If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?" Psalm 11:3
