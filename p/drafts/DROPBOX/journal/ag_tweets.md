Inhaling that second hand smoke in the alley reminds me of backpacking Europe with the brothers.

All you are saying is that your definition of ‘wrong’ should be the one we live by, rather than the definition that God set.

It sounds like you’re saying your definition of “wrong” should be the one we live by, rather than the definition God set.

I’ve known you for 12 years now and the pattern you are going through is to think through and form opinions that end with you at the right. 

I also think there is something going on that we have never discussed; Your father, ryan molesting you, drug use, personal challenges of neglect in the bible belt. Whatever those things are, you have decided to abandon the entire framework and the anger is starting to come out with much more intensity.

You are making choices that are based on the same framework we all are. This latest banter of ours about bigotry, why i said you don’t think it means what you means is that your use and views of the situation imply a very simple, single situation. There are multiple layers of human complexity you are not taking into account and these don’t even have to do with bible verses. The concept of culture and norms is noise to you, because it’s not really the point you are driving at anyway. 

You have desires you are chasing with your own self and you are exploring things and deep seeded in you is a natural and perfectly normal desire to want to make sure that your choices will be praise, admired, and respected. But when you get flack about them, you start changing the subject and name calling that those who are going to disagree with you are spiteful.

Here’s the trend I see in 12 years of knowing you, even before Anna did. I have memories of you around 8 years old while in Naples.
