5/29 AMB3R LLC advice from David McDaniel
=========================================

Yesterday was the first time that David McDaniel and I spoke where
there was some true experience and advice that I had not known. Up
until that point, it had mostly been him tracking with me and I doing
the talking.

Yesterday we spoke about establishing the business with an operating
agreement and how that would come into play.

The Operating agreement is so important for when the times change and
when we want to consider other plans, businesses, or whatever.

He explained how we should step into 2 hat roles of owner and employee
and valuing the employee hat first. By paying ourselves what we're
owed by the company and how all that is preparing us for having actual
employees.

I have some homework to do and I'm looking forward to doing it!
