Today we attended a memorial service.

Life is a raging rapid for everyone. But we fell out of the boat. I keep thinking 'once I get back into the boat, then I'll take the time to thank people who went with us on this journey. I keep having a sense of anticipation that what we are living through is a short lived ride. But it's becoming slightly more clear that it's not a single action that will get us back to normal.

This pain is a daily flow that is constant and present, just like water flows. It is at the soul level and is shaping us internally for reasons only God knows. We trust Him in that. We know that our hearts would not be formed without a season of this.

The past 3 months have felt like we fell out of the boat on a raging rapid. A combination of shock, instability, flailing, and fear have been.
The Lord is faithful and no one is immune from pain or trials.

The pain in our soul flows like water in a canyon.
Slowly our hearts are channeled according to His perfect plan.
We trust Him.

We are so very grateful to you rushing to our side with thoughts, deeds and prayers.

Love,
Dave, Danae, Oscar, & Wells
