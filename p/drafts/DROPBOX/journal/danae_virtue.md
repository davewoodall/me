Danae,

I woke up the morning thinking about your many virtues.
You are caring, kind, compassionate, friendly, teachable, supportive, optimistic, faithful full of faith, tender, tough, and genuinely respectful.

This is not an empty list I just rattle off. As I sat thinking about you and praying for us, I began to see how blind I have been from my own wounds and worries. I have unintentionally hurt you and I am deeply sorry.

As I reflect on my own life and journey, I see clearly how you have brought so much joy to my life. I think about you as a woman and my wife and want to be with you. These are thoughts I have are solely for you - even before the thought of what a wonderful mother you are. You as a mother adds an entire new dimension of life and beauty about you. 

I hope you will see the changes taking place in me as genuine steps of realization, repentance, healing, and maturity. 

I love you
