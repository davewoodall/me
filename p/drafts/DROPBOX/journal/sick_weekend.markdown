### Sick Weekend
_1/22/13_


Tuesday, back at work. I'm feeling about 85%. 

I went 'down' with a prayer that the time would be one in which I experience more of Christ. That I don't need health, wealth, or productivity in order to be at peace. To abide, which is not to dwell in the soul, or it's actions of Think, Feel, or Do. But to rest, knowing that in the Spirit - Christ can and will do those things and connect me to whatever I need. There is an internal, deeper truth in Christ which can be found in any situation. 

I felt the presence of the Lord with my relationships with Danae and the Boys. 

Then, to top it off - while I went into the weekend a little nervous that I had forgotten all I knew about Rails - the Lord gracousl

I want to just stop to explain that I am finding such peace as I abide in Christ. 

My health was tough and I have my first, big project for work. I want to bury my old man, and just remain with Christ. There seems to be nothing that can overcome his power
