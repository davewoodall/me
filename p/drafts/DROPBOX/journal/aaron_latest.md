I'll speak for myself..

The bible points to Christ, but those who receive his life find your challenge as hard as trying to negate the flowers in their backyard.

Once you lose your viginity, you cannot get it back.
Once Christ has been planted in your heart, you cannot lose his life.

I don't believe Christ is alive because of the bible.
I know He is alive because He is.

And frankly, Aaron you know that I can have these conversations with you is because I don't have any incentive to convince you.

You know I genuninely enjoy these discussions, regardless of what you believe.

Christ is not an inanimate object.
He is alive. More so than the flowers in these packets.

Just because this is a poor drawing of a flower doesn't mean it can't help me discover the real thing.
