God makes man.
Then, reveals a standard which man cannot attain.
Man proves he cannot live to it.
God changes the rules to faith.

Why?

# Progress through a parable.
A parable is a story to teach you something. It hasn't changed, but my interpretation of what it means, has.

I used to live my life according to the parable of the talents; a two part story.

First, I always wanted to be considered the man with the most talents. I eventually said I wanted to just use whatever I have, wisely.

Then, I lived according to the thought that I hope that my use of whatever talents I've been given would be pleasing to Him. The mentality I had was I simply hoped I would be a faithful steward.

Now, I've come to discover that since the Holy Spirit is in me, I no longer need to wonder if it will be said 'well done'. The talents I have are the talents he's given me. So, they wouldn't be there without him to begin. And with the accompanying of the Holy spirit on my investments, I know that he is pleased with any decision that is made, because I'm simply verbalizing what He wants of me.

I can rest assured too, that when things are lost in translation, His grace trumps my defeats.

This is my father's world.
What man can do me ill
There's nothing I need be fearful of
Because I am in his will.

Last I checked, Steven Hawking was a scientist. Science istself says it's not qualified to talke to the supernatual. What makes Hawkings atheism relevant?

Accepting the Supernatural opinions of Steven Hawking is like accepting the political views of Alex Baldwin.

Being famous for one thing doesn't make you a knowledge expert in everything.

Does bitterness stem from what you believe.
Or, do you believe what you do because you are bitter.

3/8/14 - Faith is as real and relevant to our lives as intuition, discretion, and imagination.
Now, where you place your faith. That's a separate topic.

Acknowledging faith is not the same as acknowledging God.

Money, Military, Country, Government, Science, Economists, Theories, Self;
People put their faith in the wrong things all the time.

3/6/14 Let me get this straight...If it's dead, someone made it.
But if it's living, it made itself?

3/6 - Using the word 'logic' in a counter argument doesn't necessarily mean that point is logical.

3/6 - Don't get me wrong... I'd love to be King.
But the end of the day, you have to respect the biggest Lion.

Currently, I'm of the view that the bible does not prove God, and Science does not disprove Him, either.

What if your relationship with your earthly Father is a more accurate reflection of how you view a Heavenly Father.

From my experience, I've found anyone who takes this notion seriously will find a strange *default* similarity between their  Heavily Father and their earthly father, in his worst moments.

The new learning that needs to happen is in discovering that our Heavenly Father does not act like our earthly father did when he was drunk, abusive, passive, or absent.

Replace 'Love' with God and this is Who God really is;

God is patient, God is kind. God does not envy, God does not boast, God is not proud. God does not dishonor others, God is not self-seeking, God is not easily angered, God keeps no record of wrongs. God does not delight in evil but rejoices wGodh the truth. God always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

Regardless of sex, race, or background, a basic moral code exists in us all.

Do no harm. Do not steal. Do not lie. Do not kill.

One might argue that the 10 commandments were simply God putting what He already wrote inside us, on the outside.

How can humans around the world agree on a basic unwritten moral law by accident?
