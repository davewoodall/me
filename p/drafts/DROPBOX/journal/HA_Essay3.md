Over the last 16 years I have started five companies. Through my journey I have discovered a formula for determining if a company is worth starting. In 2008, I started AMB3R.com based on my forumla. In 2011, the company achieved $750,000 in sales at a 40% gross profit margin. The formula is a blend of three ingredients and I'm sharing it for those interested in starting their own company. 

First, your company must exist to provide a solution to problem. You can explore personal problems to solve, or research frustrations that others experience. Find something that people cannot (or will not) do, and offer to do it for them. The willingness of others to pay you for your service is the signal that you have identified a legitimate problem to solve.

Second, there must be margin between what you pay and what you get paid to solve the problem. The way to do this is by using a natural resouce. Consider a natural resource as materials, vendors, or knowledge you might take for granted becuase it is easy to acquire. I like the saying "One man's trash is another man's treasure."

Third, you must provide your natural resource in a unique way. Do this by enlisting the help of an engineer. An engineer can be a computer programmer, fashion designer, or simply someone with remarkable talent. They will have the ability to view of your solution in a more creative or efficient way. By doing so, you will create a competitive advantage and most likely word-of-mouth marketing from extremely satisfied customers.

There is no magic formula to success. But if you are able to idenfity these three ingredients then the likelihood of success is often determined by your vision and determination for a better world.
