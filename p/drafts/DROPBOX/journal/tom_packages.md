Hey Tom,

I have a systematic approach to getting up to speed.

:Step 1: Review
First, I spend some time reviewing your site and forming assumptions about what you're trying to do.

:Step 2: Meeting
Then, we'll setup an hour meeting to hear your vision.
The objective of the meeting is to get on the same page and put together some initial ideas based around growing sales.

:Step 3: Basic Thoughts
From that meeting, I will provide a BASIC document like this example;
BASIC example: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13563632/hireDave/basic_thoughts.pdf

To get an idea of what I mean by "BASIC" check out:

:Step 4: Wire frames
Based on your feedback of the BASIC document, I'd develop wire frames about the code/design work to be done.
For example, Suppfinder wanted to try 'search by solutions'. I then submitted this;
Wireframe deliverable: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13563632/hireDave/wireframes_solution_search.pdf

:Step 0: Move forward
This whole process takes 4 - 6 hours. I'd be happy to take work at my hourly rate of $75, or set a flat $300 for this process.

Please let me know if you'd like to discuss further, or move forward.
