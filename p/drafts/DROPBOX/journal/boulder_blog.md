## My World

News and social Media want me to believe that being an informed citizen is what life is about. False. Media's primary concern is selling advertising to as many eyeballs possible.

_My world is much smaller than I am led to believe._

My world is what and where I can lead and influence. Currently it is 3 people with another on the way. I am living a life in Boulder and my focus should be on improving the people and events of this community. I want that reality to create a clear heart, head, and home and be able to listen to God's plan for my life.
