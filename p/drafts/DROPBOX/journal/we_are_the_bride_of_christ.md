## 3. We are the Bride of Christ.
If I made love to my bride the exact same way every time, how many times would it take before she would dread the next encounter? Is it possible I'm tired of meeting God "corporately" the exact same way for the last 20+ years?
We change every part of our life to keep it fresh and exciting except for the weekly church gathering.

Pop quiz: The common reply you get when say you're bored with church is:
A - It's the leaderships fault
B - You can't only be feed, you need to serve to make it better
C - You're a pagan
D - B &amp; C (Because it's never the leadership's fault.)

People say that they're church is so different. It's not. They're all the same. It's as if we're not allowed to do it any way else.
Every church follows the same general format; Sing 2-6 worship songs, 1-2 minute member greeting, 3-6 minutes of event announcements, a skit or song, and a 15 - 55 min message. Then you have the quarterly baptisms, communion, and committee meetings, etc. Some even do sunday school classes where singles, married, and widows gather for an hour to talk about their specific needs.
Why are all churches the same? Do we do church this way because it's the only way or because no one has thought to approach it a new way?
The point is variety is the spice of Life.
