AMB*R becomes AMB3R... maybe.
=============================

Jeremy picker started calling me about 2 months ago expressing an
interest in starting a company due to the fact that he has been
working at the same applique company that produces huge volumes of
product for major brands like abercrombie.
As we were talking I began to throw out the idea of us working
together and maybe sharing the company.
Over the course of the last 2 months I had been trying to get him to
mentally prepare for what we would need to do and the kind of
committment it would require.
So about 2 weeks ago he called me to tell me he was committed and we
have begun discussions about how we could work together.
From what I gather, he completes 2 of the 3 issues I think are
required for a successful business:
1. Must have a need
2. Must have passionate people to join
3. meet the need with a natural resource. (something we can get that
they can't without us.)

I have a more mature curiosity about this one. I am trying to do all
the proper due diligence before committing. The accounting courses
have helped me HUGE! I again have to thank Rick Denham for
recommending that to me...

I think the idea is to offer a niche product that is needed and
difficult to find among current manufacturers. We would turn around
and offer it to futura, uthstuph, majid, and other merchandisers who
would need the help...

I'm flying down to PHX to meet with Jeremy and see about setting all
this stuff up 5/1 - 5/3...

We'll see what happens.
