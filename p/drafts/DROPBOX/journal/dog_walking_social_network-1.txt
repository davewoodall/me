Dog walking social network
==========================

I'm not sure our house can handle another large dog along with our
Thanksgiving house guest, but if you get desperate we board our dogs
at Dog Topia, 341 S Lincoln, 303-722-7620, http://www.dog-topia.com/.
We've used them for years now and our dogs seem to have a great time.
I think the cost to board is around $35 a day.

Good luck!

We are supposed to watch jeremy's dog during that same time. I'll get
back to you if I have the dates wrong. I'm checking now.
If my dates are wrong we will do it! I'll check back.

Hey all,

You've received this as a bcc because I know you, trust you, and you
live within 30 miles.

I'm not going to pull any punches. We need someone to watch our dog.
Our family is headed to San Diego for about 10 days next week. My
older brother Kevin is getting married. The dates we need help are:
November 17-26.

We had something lined up and it has now fallen through which leaves
us in a bit of a predicament.

We are open to any and all ideas as we know taking on the
responsibility for someone else's dog for 10 days is asking A LOT of
you. Add in the fact that the time we need coverage is over
Thanksgiving and we are really pushing our luck....

Here are the options to consider. Reply only if you think you can help
out. Trust me, we understand if you can't or don't want to help so no
response necessary for those folks. Just respond if you think you can
make on of the below options work.

A. We are game to take Kdog for the entire time. We will bring her
into our home as we are rock stars and we already have a dog.
B. We personally would come house and dog sit, OR we know of an
awesome option that can come stay at your house and take care of the
dog.
C. We would be open to watching for X amount of days, but the whole
time does not work. Here are the dates we can help _________________
D. Here's a phone number or website to where we board our
dogs...........
E. I have a better idea for you, and here it is......

This would be a paid gig ...

Thanks!
