## 4. The physical building could actually help people discover God.
We know church is people. We hear all the time that the building doesn't matter, it's the people. If Church is the people, then why is it glued to the same weekly format? People need a gathering place. And a healthy church usually grows bigger than a home living room unless you're in China.
The problem is the physical building we attend is totally outdated. I believe it's hindering our discovery. The building is to be designed and structred to enhance and support the gathering of the people.
A proper church building will let the body meet and commune however they are led by the Spirit.
