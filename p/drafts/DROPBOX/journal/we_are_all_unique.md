## 2. We are all unique.
The Myers Briggs personality test reveals that there are 16 different personality temperaments. In addition people have their unique pathway to God in how they worship and discover God. Examples include the Intellectual, the Artist, the Feeler, the Musician, and the Contemplative. Third people's unique history influences who they are. Their family structure, wounds and hurts, and their victories all play a part in their Journey. Fourth, people are at different stages in their beliefs. The spectrum goes from Atheists to Old Believers. New Believers, Young Believers, Broken Believers all meeting together. Lastly the church is a collection of people in all stages of life. Young, old, single, married, kids divorced, widowed, etc.

Which leads me to ask; What percentage of the congregation actually gets excited when the pastor says he's going to lead us all on 40 days of purpose? Does he have a specific group in mind or just a vague crowd who need somthing to listen to?

I love those guys! None of them them are wrong and the church should recognize that and embrace all walks. Not permit one to criticize the other. Why not nurture a body where we celebrate one anothers uniquenesses and discover God in the way He created others totally different.
