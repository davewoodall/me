# Bad news is good news

_2/28/07_

Bad news about tough times only signals that we have not figured it all out. It means that people had thoughts and assumptions about wealth, growth, business, and such. They were wrong. This means there is still plenty of opportunity out there to meet needs and start something successful. It's a time to think, pray, plan, and make the bad times better.

Bad news really only affects those who sit back and watch it on TV when it's time to get to work. Figure out what opportunities you can take advantage of when all others are giving in and giving up.
