Just got laid off from factory. Apparently they lost a big portion of their business from Oakley, North Face, and Calloway.

I trust God in this uncertain time. He knows all of this and my prayer is that I can abide and take each step with faith, joy, love, and peace.

What should I do next?

Praying...

Thank You Lord for what You are doing, and how You are doing it!

- atlanta?
- denver?

I want to do it different this time. I want to use these failures and set backs as a chane to discover God in my total weakness. My fears are that I will lose my chance to become a developer. That I will continue this losing streak.

35 and unemployed could send me into despair. Life is going the opposite direction I thought it should be.

As I was grocery shopping last night, I was thinking through the new articles and the absurdity of the Billionaire who is bickering about not being in the top 10 wealthiest of the world. Or the other billionare who bought 7 Greek islands. Combine that with the thought of the challenges I have in my marriage, having trouble knowing how to thrive with a wounded wife. I just want to release my perceptions of how this temporary life is to unfold. I don't want to put it into a definition of success merited on the stuff and success I achieve.

My tendency is to dive right into tasks. Thinking that I need to hurry up and get stuff done. However, that is not the case at all.

Jesus, my brother, and the Son of God knows exactly who I am, what I need, and how to get it. He is fully in control. I am not the shepherd, He is.

Lord, what would You have me to do this morning. What is Your goald and desire for my life. I am not stressed or concered because You deliever us time and time again.

There are so many things I want to do;
- Think about my next role
- Craft a personal marketing plan
- Read books and learn more
- Network and have coffee with people to discuss
- Wait on You
- Hear from You
- Improve my developer skills

Watching a violent movie last night gave me a thought that there are two ways to go through this life. One is to engage in it and it's wickedness. To be exposed to all the violence and hatred by volunarily associating with it.

The other is to endure this life, to be saved from it, as I walk with the Lord.To be in the world but not in a way of seeking to experience how lost souls are.

While I am praying for rain, I shouldn't be comforted by the storm clouds. In fact, I do not know how or where my water will come, except that it will come from the Lord.

I am thankful the Lord reminded me of Genesis 3 - that I am called to live in a way that does not eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

_Lord, as I walk today with no understanding or clairty of purpose, I ask that I may only eat of the tree of life. Jesus, You have a plan for me and unemployment and obscurity are part of it. Thank You. I know I will look back on these times, praising You for sustaining us, and thanking You for what You did in, through, and around me._

Over the past 3 weeks I've interviewed a few times but no job offers yet. I was also invited to join a tech stars team

I'm excited to start my job with Vacation Rental Partners in two weeks. As I listen to founders and other business executives, I feel as though I enjoy the topic but have not achieved the level of strength, need, or privilege to run a company like that. Part of why I'm interested in programming is it's a well paying job that bides my time and provides for my family.
