The vine and the branch
=======================

We went to the breast feeding class last night. I had an interesting
experience learning how the baby needs to latch on properly for
benefit of the mother and baby.
My mind then wandered to the idea of the Vine and the Branch. I have
found that another analogy that I like is the idea that I have a
spiritual plug and Christ is the outlet. He is the source of the power
and I need to plug in regularly.

> Warren Bennis writes that “leaders learn by leading,and they
learn best by leading in the face ofobstacles.As weather shapes
mountains,problems shape leaders. Difﬁcult bosses,lack ofvision
and virtue in the executive suite,circumstances beyond their
control,and their own mistakes have been the leaders’ basic
curriculum.”

By plugging into Christ, by abiding in His life You will begin to
observe that it too changes you and your behaviour. This isn’t
impractical spiritual change, this will change you. For when Christ
has control of your existence, your life becomes that if Him living
through you. And you then are doing what Christ would do as though it
were you.

Remember this, Prayer does not save you. It is the act of connection
with God. It is God on the other side of that prayer who has all the
power to save and set you free to live.
This goes for the Bible as well. The bible is not the answer, it
points to the answer. These are both mediums to which we approach and
commune with God.
The real issue is the heart. The Lord is not looking for duty, but a
Spirit searching for Him.
