Christmas season. Showing my love to Danae for her sake 15 Dec
Danae was weak and sick all the holiday and the drive to and from.
While I have been serving her, I know my attitude has not be the most
loving.
Lord, Create in me a clean attitude. Jesus’ attitude of love,
kindness, patience, goodness, fondness, and gentleness toward my
amazing wife.

Above and beyond

 1. Wisdom for my involvement
 2. Wisdom for purpose of the Ministry.

I’ve gone as far as I feel I can before Shawn needs to respond back to
me. We had that meeting on 12/28/07 to reconnect. If he needs help he
needs to show some reciprocation. If not, then I will drop it.

23 Jan
A week and a half ago I met with Shawn and Ken for a 2 hour meeting.
We had homework assignments and Shawn just bailed on for the next
meeting. I feel so bad for the guy. He’s just stuck in some kind of
rut.
I sent them a follow up email, hopefully they’ll respond.

Lord, Bless us with this NAMB Job! ($17,000)
UPDATE 15 Dec
Got a call yesterday from NAMB that they want me to submit some art
comps! It turns out we were $20-25k higher in the bid, not 100k higher
as i originally thought. Sounded like from the phone call that the PM
got into a little trouble for not having me submit art! That felt like
the Lord was in there speaking on my behalf.
I have lost the emotional attachment to the job, but I am still asking
the LORD to bless us with it.

12 Dec
I heard back from NAMB that they’re going to go with another supplier
for this job. I asked why and she ‘thinks’ that they got another offer
for the entire job at $25,000. (Our bid was at $150k!).
Well Amen.
I know the Lord is faithful. I had just wanted so bad to get my teeth
fixed, put some money away to refinance this house, and have a down
payment for a house in Colorado.
While that was my perspective, it appears that the Lord has other
plans.
I don’t want to think other thoughts than that I simply don’t see the
bigger picture.
It stings a little too because I’ve had a downright shitty sales year.
I can’t tell which reason, but this would have almost put me at par.

>_Lord, I am going to claim that if I know now what You know, I would
choose this path. However, since i am finite and small, I have no true
perspective. Let me dwell in Your safe place. Let my soul rest in
peace that you are my shepherd, father, guide, and source of existence
still._

23 Jan
We did not get the order. That’s the nature of this business. I want
to see God show up in these situations, because I know He’s here
working them all for the good and unto His glory.

Denver Transition
12 dec

 1. Praying for us to be able to refinance 904 jones to a lower rate
    and mo. payment.
 2. Have some money to make a down payment for a home in CO.
 3. Get Futureshirts.com to a place where I can do more in less time.

21 dec
Should we sell the house?

4 Jan
I think we’re going to refinance, then fix up and try to rent / sell
later. I think a May 1 departure is more realistic than March 1.

Father, May I trust You with the Details. May I walk in Your ways.
Would Jesus be the Life and source as we walk here by faith and
courage as the pressure of the temporary compels me to press on.

11 Jan
Met with the refi-guy last night. Seems our prep work is paying off.
Our credit scores are high, our debt-to-income ratio is also decent at
34%.
Lord, I just ask that You lead us in wisdom and truth. Show us the way
to equity.

30 Jan
We’ve refinanced the house! Praise the Lord! We got a lower rate.
We have 3 things remaining:

 1. Fix the upstairs plumbing – It’s so clogged…
 2. Put Storm Windows on – protection
 3. Find renter for $1,200 a month. – It’s high, but I will never know
    unless I ask. I would be okay with $1,100 if they signed a 2 year
    deal.

Lord, You have been so faithful with all these details. I know you are
working all things for good. May we have the opportunity to tell this
story of how we moved out of tennessee!! woo hoo!

10 Mar
Well Amen we are here! I think it took a lot out of Danae and it added
some stress to our lives but the Lord is faithful. We are trusting Him
with our establishment and growth here. Our apartment is cute and will
def work. We are in the last minor details of finding an office for
me, getting a rentor in our home in Nashville, and getting our car
safely transported out here.

Finances in order

16 Dec
Trying out quicken to see if that’s the solution for us.

24 Jan
I can’t seem to get into Quicken. That it’s to much stuff for our
meager salary. I’m thinking of trying the old fashioned check
register.

4 Feb
I think we may have found our system for now! It’s a simplified
version of accounting books. Lord willing Danae can do it.

3/12
Praise the Lord this system we’ve developed is actually working! Danae
is doing it on her own and knows what she needs to do. she has also
been feeling that the Lord is telling her to be faithful in the little
so that she can handle more.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Where does that internal drive for greatness come from?
If it’s from You, i would ask you to complete what You’ve started.
Please connect, develop, teach, and lead me in the way I should go to
be a faithful steward.
If this is residue of the flesh, please let Christ’s power and Life be
shed on the darkness and root it out that I may be unto Him.

24 Jan
Maybe I’m focused, but this ‘feeling’ has worn off some. I am still
excited about life and accomplishing big things. I just want to keep
the proper attitude.

 1. Find one that the environment is conducive to education
 2. Close to home
 3. Blessed by God.

4 Jan
I’m going to speak with Madeline to see if she would need some help. I
would love to learn the rental property business as well as doing the
book keeping. Then, what if I could buy out her business down the
road!

23 Jan
In light of recent events, we may be heading out to CO sooner than
later. I may not be able to swing this one…

4/28
I had a great conversation with David McDaniel and he suggested that
while accounting is important, the real creative and executive type
roles are in finance.

My relationship w/ ROn
27 Dec
Need to set aside time to let him talk
-
Design studio blessed 3/29

I am working hard to have this idea survive. My prayer is for proper
help, people, location, finances, and even customers.

I am seeing that I have no power, but to walk where the Lord leads in
this project.

Lord I pray You lead me in the way I should go. W/o Your involvement,
this will not stand. Please build on Your solid foundation.

4/28
I have put this on hold. It takes back seat to AMB3R and school. If it
wasn’t so difficult to implement with Jon and Futura I would have
continued. Jon is beyond his capacity… I should take a lesson from his
life of unfocused living.
-
more sales with futura 12/10
3/12
Out here in Denver! I’m driving up to MT on Monday to talk w/ Jon
about the Denver Office Plan. Hoping to get approval to be able to
implement my gameplan.

3/14
This month is the best sales month of my career! Not only that, I have
the highest single tee sale in my life, a $46,000 sale!!! Praise the
Lord. He is faithful.

4/28
With the introduction of AMB3R, futura is taking a transitionary back
seat. I will continue to maintain, but I am not interested in growing
beyond what the Lord will provide here.

Looking at NOEL’s office space 3/29

Should I go there b/c it’s local or b/c it’s the best spot available.
Is there a better spot I should be?

4/28
Looking to sign a 6 month lease for Jimmy wall’s basement until I can
find something better. His place is remodeled and bigger than what i’m
currently in so def an improvement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What to say to Jon (Transition out of futura) 4/29/8

After talking with David McDaniel, he advised that I keep everything
above ground. That I should talk with Jon and ask him his thoughts on
the whole losing of clients and such.
I want to pray for wisdom, courage, and understanding.

5/19

Last week I had the conversation. I will go to a 1099 employee and
begin to operate as an LLC. This is probably the best way to
transition out.
Jon knows there is not much else he can do. He is the one who
suggested the LLC / 1099 – which works perfect for AMB3R…
Lord, I pray you set us up!

That you would expand my mind Deep and Wide, and that I would be able
to clearly communicate the revelation.

13 April
I’ve also added Compassion to this list. I want to hold those who are
different with respect and love and not belittle them for any reason.

4/28

 1. Christ in me – Recognize the source!
 2. Cleanliness – The content coming to me be pure

Healthy and safe Baby 10 Dec/07

1/11
Danae went for her 12 week check up yesterday and we found out we have
a healthy baby so far! Praise the Lord! She heard the heart beat.
in 8 more weeks we find out what the gender is.
I would love a boy. It’s what I’ve imagined teaching and training. But
life and God can offer something else if His will prefers.
We’re excited!

4/28
3 months away from Oscar coming into this world. I can’t wait for the
changes to happen. God is in control!
