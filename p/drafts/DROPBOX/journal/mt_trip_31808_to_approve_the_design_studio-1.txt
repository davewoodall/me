MT trip 3/18/08 (To approve the Design Studio)
==============================================

I drove 6 hours, at about 100 mph to MT on Monday to meeet with Jon
about the design studio.
We spent about 2 hours hashing it out and he is willing to try it with
20k startup and for a year launch pad.
I laid out a office plan that covers all components of the deal
including Sales, marketing, samples, production, operations, and
financial goals.
I'm excited about trying it to see if this idea is legit.
He also said that if I could get 3 of these things off the ground he
would give me 50% of the company. (I need to get that in writing!)

I'm curious if we're going to be able to land the spot that I like. It
seems to be the ideal layout and size. I'm not entirely positive it's
the best location, but I'm going to spend the next 30 days making
sure.

I'm also wondering how I'll do when school starts in the fall. From
what I understand, I will only be able to work 15 - 20 hours a week. I
can only leave that to the Lord in how that schedule will balance out.

I suppose if I had to choose, I would say that I would put the growth
of the office plan on hold while I go to school. Or I could see about
hiring someone I know and trust to help me with the establishment of
it.
What I mean is that I believe I can juggle both. But for a long term
development and investment, I need to do grad school. I will fight for
the DS to grow and succeed while in school, and I believe it can in
fact do so, but I know that in the unfortunate chance that something
needs to give I need it to be the design studio in the short term.
