# It's like Boyscoutts, for Dads.

I never went to boyscouts, so I could be way off base here. But I'm pretty sure their mission was to prepare boys for more than roasting marshmellows around a campfire.

This hobby of mine might be me doing boyscouts, 30 years later. Now, the context has changed and I'm doing it as a dad.

Is the Boyscouts motto 'always be prepared' referring to fun, or emergency?
Maybe it's time to have a version for dads. What does updated, adult cirriculum look like for boy scouts for dads?

I need a end goal to work toward.

The boyscouts have a handbook, and I'm using grandpappy's manual as my guide book.
