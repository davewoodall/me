Thoughts pt 2
=============

I don’t have to memorize HTML or CSS, I just need two good reference
books to pull out the content I need. I have a good grasp on them now.

I can use ROR to create static pages:
RHTML in Views
CSS in style sheets
Question – How do I post that onto a public hosting? Do I just upload
the the entire ruby file?

Re: programming for a database, so far I feel that I have discovered
the general basics of what is required for the project. Now it’s
getting in and doing it.

I am going to take a break on programming now while I start to focus
on school and AMB3R’s establishment.

I hope to be able to come back and build AMB3R’s database using ROR –
but I reel that realistically I should consider working with a company
that will build it for me.
