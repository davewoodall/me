Great questions.

I think you are touching on two larger issues when we first encounter the next step in our walk with Christ.

First, the mystery of Growth. We do not simply begin in maturity. We need to learn and discover through council, failure, and contrast how life is to be lived.

The bible alludes to this progress in many direct and indirect ways. That we need to try to live to a holy standard and fail before we will completely hand over personal, holy aspirations. (For only Christ can live the Holy life. And now that the Holy Spirit is here, He will live Holiness in us.)

Second, How can I be sure I am really hearing Christ, instead of my own desires, or even the deceitfulness of the enemy. Your point about scripture will confirm the attributes of the three voices battling inside you. As we test and contrast them with what scripture says of the voices, you will discover who's who. (This is the reality of a spiritual battle!)

Keeping our Faith in Christ alone is a belief that He alone is responsible to finish what He started in us. Personally, I find it the most freeing way to live with Christ so far.
