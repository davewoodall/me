that's okay my love. we're in it till death do us part.

I was just listening to various Ecclesiastes 7;

Do not pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you for you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others. This only have I found: God created mankind upright, but they have gone in search of many schemes.
