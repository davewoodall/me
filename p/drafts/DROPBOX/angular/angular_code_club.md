# Angular Code Club

## Assumptions
- heard of angular
- know it’s related to JavaScript. Where Rails allowed you to gloss over ruby to some degree, It’s hard to think we can do the same thing with Javascript.

there is a lot of territory and simple demos are misleading b/c I think they set you up for a wrong impression of what is needed. I think a group makes for a great way to support the entrance into a new, big topic.


## Reasons to consider Angular
- conventions
- community
- vocabulary
- common problems addressed
- doug ramsey told us this is the direction we're headed.
 

## Questions
### Why are you learning angular?
### What do you think we as livingSocial are learning it?
### What problems do you think this tool solves?
### Know what it means to be declarative vs. imperative?
