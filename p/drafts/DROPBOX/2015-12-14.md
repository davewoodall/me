Danae goes on to call me the following...
- crazy
- pot
- agressive
- not listening
- amped up
- on edge about myself 
- oscar skinny
- os


Then proceeds to throw away my grass.

Okay. but what's the real problem?

I am trying to tell my kids to start eating their dinner and she gives me the eyes as if the solution is to stop talking. We are a family that sleeps in the same bedroom but Danae doesn't want to hear any of my words of instruction or disciplines.
