# Boulder Journal

## _4/26/13_ 5am

It's been a while since I've been up early. I am looking forward to a Full Time Job because it keeps me on a schedule. I have missed prayer and quiet times which have been lost in the shuffle. If I don't do it in the morning, I seem to never do it.

I am so thrilled to be programming. There is a part of me that feels it's the career that I've always been looking for. I can't help but think of the past conversations I had with my dad as I asked him how I should provide for my family. I love the problem solving, ability to communicate, and becoming a craftsman of the computer which is one of the greatest tools man has invented.

I also reflect back on a conversation I had with my parents three years ago. At the time I was still planning on the MBA and told them that I had accomplished everything I wanted to in entrepreneurship and personal adventures. I had no idea how the twists and turns would be of AMB3R, or Programming.

It took nearly two years for the transition to occur. From denial of MBA to a simple and quiant life of Boulder. A place that I am so thankful to be! It's feels like what Old Hickory felt in 2006, when we first moved there. Calm, quiet, peaceful. However, it's funny what experience does to you; I don't dive fully into that serene feeling because I know it wasn't forever with Old Hickory. Still, I am trying to tell myself to enjoy this season as it is my current reality. My sons are 4 & 2. The Lord is providing our needs everyday.

I think there is a part of me that feels life is too good to be true right now. I have these phantom scenarios in the back of my head that the government, economy, my relationships, health, or job will soon fall out and send everything back into a tailspin.

But I don't want to think about those fears. I would rather thank the Lord and simply live in this brief moment that feels like Heaven on Earth. What a treat.

## 4/27

How should I spend my time?
How should I invest I?
What should my focus be?
How much should I think about growing an income?
Who can help me?

## 4/29

First day starting back work as a developer! I'm so excited to be employed again and to have it as a code. And, to have life in Boulder is awesome!

_Thank You, Lord for meeting our needs._

Another tooth chiped again. Father, could You show us how to get our teeth fixed? As in, who to go to, how to pay for it, when to go, etc. We are clueless.

Now that I have taught Andy & Hayes about coding, I'm thinking I could teach more students. I think it would make some good money if I could teach 10 students at a time.


## 4/30

Second day at my new gig... wow.

I can't help but feel like I'm living a touch of paradise. I am so thankful for my job and this season of life.
- Living in Boulder
- Workin in boulder
- Biking to work
- Programming
- Meeting some friends
- Raising my sons
- Thinking about sidework
- building websites
- Living a simple life.

I can see how easy this life can suck me into a sense of arrival. But, Lord, I want Your will. You led us here for Your purposes. It is not about money and personal glory. My life is unto the revelation and Glory of Jesus Christ in and through me. I wait and trust in You


## 5/6

Had my first board meeting with Abiding Life. As they explained that they didn't have a budget, I also wondered about the idea of marketing something.

Is preparing and updating content for digital accessability considered marketing, or reformatting?

I think they come in two-fold. The ability to make the material, digital. Then, the role or promoting that same material via social media or other means.

_Father, may I see the world through Jeseus's eyes. May the things I think, see, feel, hear, and do be those of a Spiritual realm.

When I think of my grandfather modeling evangelism, I get uncomfortable. Then, when I think of myself doing what he did, I get even more uncomfortable. Now, I'm wondering if that's spiritual warfare. So, I start thinking, maybe I want to join the battle. Then, I'm back to trying to figure out what to do, in my own strength.

I believe in God. The world is too beautiful and miraculous to think otherwise.However I do not know my role or contribution. I believe my life is one where I am being prepared for something, at some time. For even as I read the scriptures I consider myself joining the ranks of Paul in the minstry somehow. But I don't know when, where, or how that is.

## 5/7

God is preparing people in the small, quiet places. I am a programmer with no money and challeges gaining momentum at work and home. I have put forth several attempts but all prove fruitless.

Now, my job is to learn to work online, a sort of modern author. While my products are interactive they are very temporal. I think that might be fitting knowing that this is not my home.

I believe that God is preparing me for something. I've lived long enough to develop a patience for that 'something' and if it is to be revealed in the next life.

I love that we live in Boulder. I love that I get to do what I do for work. I must trust the Lord with our finances and stuff. Lord, could You change me to be the Husband, Father, Provider, and Friend that You want me to be.


## 5/9

My co-worker, Eric, knows his stuff. What's interesting though is that he's not super rigid. I'm trying to be the best beginner possible, while it seems he's the most casual senior developer I have encountered so far.  In one way that's weird because I want to learn from the best. The other way, the contrast between his casual approach and my inexperience makes for not such an extreme.

The other thing is how I am starting at virtually zero with finances, again. I don't want to put my faith in any system, but at this point things have changed.
- Business LLC account with Steele Street
- Deb as a bookkeeper
- Danae is no longer in Etrade
- Etrade is setup to be used for bills, tithe, and savings
- We started new simple checking accounts for spending.

I have lost hope that my issues are systems. I seek You, Oh Lord. That You would bless our resources. That You are the One who brings all increase. As I stand, almost 36 years on this earth. I would like to be one who lives in abundance and not in debt. I am nearly 200k in debt with school loans and 904 jones.

Lord, I wait on You. Thank YOU!

### Things that are not built
This is a list of things I acknowledge that are not complete. However, I want the Lord's will, not mine. If He chooses that we do not receive these things as I state them, then amen. My goal is the revelation of Christ, the Maker of me and holder of all things. I wait on You Jesus. You provide our needs.

- My Teeth
- A community
- Writing subjects (purposes)
- Finances
- Ministry
- How to Raise the boys

## 5/13/13

Can I make money without taking the credit? I want to have more than I need. To stop living in debt. To be able to show my kids and wife the beauties of this world. I don't want to serve money, Lord. I believe You are doing something great inside me, Danae, and my children. I would love to visit my family in GA & FL. To connect the boys with their loved ones. We would love to help out other people and ministries. Father, search and know my heart.

I can only learn so much programming at one time. So, I find it nice to have Eric be someone who seems half-hearted. That my contribution can be some of the soft skills, and making him look good. I keep pushing to learn and grow


## 5/28

Arrived at the office at 6:15 am. Tuesdays are my long days, where I tack on School/Education parts to my day.

I want to see God in everything. That is done through the eyes of Faith. To believe that God can be seen in a multitude of ways.

"But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die."
- Genesis 3:3

An interesting thought that there are two types of death. The one that occurs because of disobedience. The other as Christ was offered to die in our place. That He served unto death, that we might live. Two different outcomes and purposes, but both experiencing the same process. What can we learn from this?

There is a death that produces life.
And there is a life that brings death.

The one who thinks you will live, will die.
The one who thinks you will die, will live.

## 5/31

Credit card was hacked for $975. AMEN. I will see God in it.
Spent $260 going to a concert with Jimmy & Amanda. I will see God in it. I believe He allowed Danae and I to have some time alone.
I just lost a freelance project because client needs it on Monday, but we are going camping. AMEN. I will see God in that too.

Lord, we are blessed beyond believe because of You.


## 6/5

Camped with my family for the first time, in the Sand Dunes.


    You put this song in my heart.
    You turned my life around.

    I am eternally grateful
    for I am not capable


_6/18/13_

### I missed the boat
I missed the chance to get an MBA. Not that that's the worst thing. Just that I'm 35 now and I see how it does not provide the value it once did. I'm curious what can I learn that is worth learning. It feels like programming is the new English.

### My new hobby
I'm starting a new hobby which is a mash up of farming and camping. It is my attempts to prepare for what could become an economic downturn. I don't know how it will all shake down, but I'm starting to blog about it on fakefarm.com


_6/22/13_

Danae is pregnant! Wow, I want this one to be different than the others. In that I allow the pressures, questions, and expansion all be new opportunities to see how God continues to remain faithful. I don't want to carry these burdens, because I can't.

Lord, I surrender how it works out with dr visits and other financial hurdles.


_6/25/13_

I am better off than I think or feel I am because of the indwelling Christ. He leads, guides, and provides!

In all of my aspiring talents, hard work, and ideas, I still have not found a place to grow in my career. I believe that You are doing something in and through me because of that.

I want to try to begin my wants and needs in the Spirit, as opposed to my mind or emotions. For, I do not know, but God knows.

I bring to you, Father, all the various financial requirements; school loans, baby doctor visits, teeth, car repair, kids schooling, fake farming, screen printly, web camp, and the so many things I lack in my own existence.


_6/27/13_

Just had a 45 min talk with Eric, the sr. dev at work. He has some 'big concerns' about my contribution to the app. My emotions are trying to kick in and take over and I am fighting feelings of inadequacy...

Lord, I don't want to live from my soul, I want to live from the Spirit. How does that matter in regards to providing for a family? What would you have me to be or do?
Thank You that You are in control. I want Your thoughts. Your feelings. Your actions. I am at a complete loss.

I trust that You are leading the way to where I belong. PRAISE GOD that this is not my life. This is a count down to the life that is coming...

_6/28/13_

Can I recognize that my spirit is not a place, but a living Person, Jesus Christ. Can I discover that I am not alone in times when things get uncertain. It is in these moments that the Lord will show Himself true & faithful.

Technology has been a refuge where I thought I could hide and let life form around a comfortable job. But life is more than this and the Lord knows it. He's giving me the opportunity to live like no one else in that He is revealing that no matter if I have not means of income, He is still with me, and will forever provide.

Today is a brand new day. It is also temporary. While I may want Boulder, biking to work, Invited Home, and aspiring developer to be my heaven; they're not. Just as Delmar, Jones, Downing, and Neilsen are in the past, so will Darley. I am thankful for these brief, vacation-like moments. The Lord is at hand and He is in control.



_7/1/13_

Came to the realization that my biggest, conscious weakness is my vocation and income. I believe I have many more weaknesses, but this one I am most aware and distracted by. I struggle with my inability to find employment and pay bills. The Lord gave me a gracious revelation that I can admit that, in order to realize that He is my income and vocation provider. I am a child of God and He has called me to a realization of freedom in Him.


My talk w/ Eric last week has me spooked. I can't tell if I'm about to get fired. I have had many challenges getting up to speed, but thankfully the Lord provides.


_7/24/13_

The Lord maintains all that He creates. Including me. Including my needs. Including my family. Including my body.

I feel as though the chemistry is beginning to cool between Eric, the Sr. dev, and myself. He lacks management, leadership, and people skills.

I am becoming uncomfortable with the lack of communication. We don't talk unless I have something. He has pretty much disengaged from working with me. I try to justify it as something where he's busy with the launch, that was to happen 3 weeks ago.

My point is that I want to surrender another potential bout of unemployment. Whereas I was able to see Factory as out of my control, what happens if I get let go? The truth is, God is in control.

My desire is for the revelation of Christ, in me. I can trust Him as He leads us on an adventure.

Thank you, Lord for being involved. I see You in all of this.

_8/13/13_

For whatever reason, I feel as though my contract at work could end soon. It's making me want to get ready so that I'm not caught completely by surprise.
The Lord has continued to provide ways for me to survive - be it a job, starting my own company, a freelance gig, government assistance, or help from mom & dad. He always provides. I have no need to fear when God is on my side.

_8/14/13_

I'm a professional transitioner with experience being fired, laid off, sold, quiting, leaving prematurely,  and tipped off.


_8/15/13_
Things we're facing with the Lord;
- About to lose my job
- Finances are tight
- Danae is pregnant
- we lack insurance
- 904 jones renter moving out
- Looking to sell the house
- still at 'entry level' coder

Lord, thank You for seeing and walki/ng w/ us on this.

_9/17/13_

In the past week;
- Aaron is critically ill. Been in the ICU for almost 3 weeks. I flew out to Manhattan to see him. He is in rough shape.
- We found out we are having a girl. Whoa. While I felt like the Lord would be so gracious, it was still a pleasan surprise.
- Boulder's 100 year flood came through and gave me a chance to meet my neighbors
- Talking with Minh about helping him with App-press as business development. I feel like that would be a nice relief since my role as a developer is so hard and slow going. While I enjoy coding, I just don't feel that I'm at a place to be productive yet.

I took out a loan so that I can subsidize my learning. I have learned so much over the past year and a half. While I don't fully get it yet, I just wonder how much longer I need to live in ignorance. I am still ramping up with 3rd Revolution and just hope that I will be able to contribute to this code base.

_Lord, this season has given me some time to stop and hear from You. And, to watch as You lead, guide, and provide for our lives. It is not my performance, plans, or pursuits that lead me to success - but You. If you choose to keep me here. You will provide. If You choose to switch platforms back to business - Only You will provide._

I spoke with Minh today and he is interested in my joining App-press.com in a business developer role. While I don't know fully what that would entail, the notion of stepping back into a role as business executive is intriguing. However, as I'm saying - it's the Lord who sustains, not my competence.

### Things I could do code-related if I didn't have this job
- Maintain my own blog
- Keep building side projects for the fun of it.
- Manage my life through dev tools - unix, sublime, rails side gigs like DAT.

_9/23/13_

A journal using vim. I've been curious for a while about it, and I feel like it's a little break from javascript and coding. I enjoy writing and being the most efficient, so I feel like this is worth a shot.

I had a 2nd call with James of K3 web agency. He clearly sees that I need some help. I am still far off from where he, or I want to be in regards to writing code, but I hand that over to the Lord.

I'm focusing on learning JavaScript, Rails, Angular, and just contributing to a team.
I started building [destroy all tasks](www.destroyalltasks.com) which is a fun side project to incorporate these things.

## Javascript
- JSON
- Language
- AJAX
- HTTP
- Browsers
- Events


## 6/10/13

Working through Rebuilding Rails. It's interesting to see how many times developers work to abstract apps into multiple requirements.


## 6/5/13

Thinking that I should look to focus heavily on Rails, Ruby, and software development in those related areas.
Seeking to focus on stories that are related topics, and proactively avoid the javascript, frontend, design, or other tasks.
While they are helpful, I'd like to become intermediate, at minimum, before switching primary focus.

- Ruby
- Rails
- Validations
- TDD
- RSpec
- Factory Girl
- Active Record
- Capybara
- Associations
- Metaprogramming
- Refactoring
- Scopes
- Callbacks
- Authentication

All the 'invisible' parts of the app. The more hidden, the better. :-)
