I'm starting to take all these random topics and connect the dots. For example, I don’t trust the government or illunimati or their claims about evolution or big bang. 

And from a loyalty standpoint,  I’d rather side with christians (read: the church) who are showing me through their science experiments and the bible how a flat earth promotes a creator. Those Christians are also poking holes through a globe as in, asking questions like water levels, light, and rotation I never thought about. They also do a good job (for me) of explaining how a lucifierian agenda is using a globe for their purposes.

So I've come to the personal conclusion that I’d rather hang out in those circles even if they are wrong. I don’t want anything to do with satan or his insights, even if evidence weights in his favor. I'm opting for a minority opinion in and hope the Church is right and aligned with Christ and truth.
