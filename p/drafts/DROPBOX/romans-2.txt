Romans

"Because the Law worketh Wrath : For where no Law is, there is no
transgression" 4:15
There are two `realities' in which to live. To totally different
earthly experiences.
One is where you live in the law, which gives a person context.
The other is to live in faith, where the law is removed, and so is the
context of right and wrong. We are then led by the Spirit, the very
inventor or the Law, righteousness, and truth.
He is the One who setup these new laws of righteousness. They are so
contradictory to our flesh and man nature of how we should obtain the
purity we truly desire.

"Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that
is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh
intercession for us." Rom 8:34
What a powerful and wonderful point. The very One who sacrificed His
life for us that we might live, is also the one who makes the
judgement call on who accepted it or not. He knows us His brethren.
Which is why we say there is no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus! AMEN!

"But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who
hath believed our report? So then, faith cometh by hearing, and
hearing by the word of God." Rom 10:17
I used to take that last portion saying we need to get the Word of God
(The bible) out there and let people hear it. However, I think that
may be a misinterpretation of the point. Paul is saying - I feel -
that unless God open's their ears, they will not hear. For not all
hear and believe what is being said.
