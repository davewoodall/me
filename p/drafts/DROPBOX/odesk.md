Please pay off my account with my AMEX account. I'm on this page and I don't see a PAY button. 


Then, in your reply - please send me information on how to cancel my account. (Or do it for me if you can.) 
The combination of a terrible UI and an amazingly slow site (I assume you don't use caching) I will not be back (other than to cancel my account)

I even tried to help them out!
(Past in the chat transcripts..)
