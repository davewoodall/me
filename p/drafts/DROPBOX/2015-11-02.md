Hey Jon!

Good to hear from you! Any days or times better for you?

For those of you who started Trick or Treating early On Friday.
I posted a vision for LivingSocial 2.0 that I sent to GT today.
There's a one page summary on page 3.

@alan, I don't have an exact number but the trends are compounded with;
- we keep losing money
- we are not hitting our estimates
- we are encountering challenges in the code - stepford, outages, etc.

July is an estimate and if things are entangled then things will snowball based on how _the end_ works.


I'm sorry. My intention wasn't to create alarm with the 8 months. The point of my talk was that our focus in the _short term_ should be to work as a company to create such a high excitement of who we are and what we're capable of that it would _even_ re-invigorate investoers for more funding.
