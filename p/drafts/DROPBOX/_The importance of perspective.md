The importance of perspective.

Let me start with an example. Even though an NFL game of exhibition is the same as the super bowl, why do people prefer to watch the latter? It's because they have perspective and know that it means something different.

I think people find it irrelevant when someone brings up their faith or supernatural things as though they don't matter in the context of the situation. but You can find out why things are done, or how someone will view a situaiton when you understand their perspectives.

If you think this is an exhibition game, then you also view it as meaningless. And your behavior will show that by skipping the game, or simply not paying attention to things like the score. But when it's the super bowl, you want to know what's going on. Even the ancelary items, like the commercials are importnat. we know that the following monday, it will be topic of the office, and even the news.
