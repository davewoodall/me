- get over my own judgement
- two types of churches
- the church which is his body, and the corner building
- lots of benefits
- gives me more reason to tell people about this great place
- i am not the center
- what they preach is not the point
- this body of christ is from a kingdom that opperates in the opposite way that organizations do.
- if your church gets pointers from management consultants, then you might be a country club.

- play dates
- free breakfasts
- shooting ranges
- work connections
- beers with buddies
- summer bar b ques
- birthday get togethers


I've grown up in the church my whole life. I think I found it stale because I was looking for something that wasn't in there. I was looking for spirituality inside four walls.

Christ is not in bricks, he's inside of You and me.
I'm sincerely not trying to reverse psychology people with this blog. My goal is not for a club member to read this and say 'we need to make our club more church like'. You can't because Christ is not marrying an organization, theologoy, or building. He is marrying those who call Him their savior. If you confess that, then You are the Church.

Maybe it's that Christians were smart enough to call their gathering religious to get the benefits and get the government off their back.


I am of the opinion that simply spending time together is enough of an agenda among believers because the Holy Spirit is in us and will lead us to whatever needs to be discussed - wisdom, confession, counsel, etc.
