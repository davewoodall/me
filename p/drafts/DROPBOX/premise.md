the premise

IT sounds good and well to say 'lets try to do this to be more like christ'.
No one sets a goal to get to where they are, already. They set a goal to track their progress to be somewhere they are not currently.

Christian goals are 'let's spend 5 min to be more like christ.'

If you choose to sign up for that, you are implying that you are not already close to God.

It's hard to accept that your unsatisfied life could be where God wants. But at this point, you have two choices;

1. try to get somewhere you already are with a desired outcome that you will arrive at your new image of yourself.

2. Begin, by faith, to recognize that you are already with God and that in recognizing, You are empowered.
