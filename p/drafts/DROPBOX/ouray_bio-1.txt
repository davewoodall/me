Dave has been in apparel for thirteen years. He was introduced to the
business by touring with bands and selling merchandise at concerts. He
soon after started a clothing line with a heat press and sold tees to
college classmates. The clothing line was ultimately carried by 100
retailers and two mall kiosks before going out of business. He
received a degree in Advertising and paid the bills as a freelance
designer for four years. He is currently attending DU for a Masters in
Finance.

Dave spent three years as a Product Developer for a merchandise
company developing new business and designing product lines. His
biggest sale was a $186,000 project for 32,000 tees. In 2008 he
started an apparel service to create creative tees for clients whose
projects lacked a significant `cool factor' but wanted people to get
people to wear tees beyond the required event. In the first 9 months
of the business he did $250,000 in revenues. He has consulted clothing
companies about their businesses on a number of occasions.

His belief is that the apparel industry is a commodity market and in
such a competitive environment, where people are not in need of your
product, leaders need to create an emotional appeal for products
through innovative and creative means.
