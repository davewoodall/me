In the hour after.

After Olivia passed away a nurse came in. Danae cannot stop herself from engaging, so she told the nurse what she was thinking. Danae said that dogs require a 2 month gestation because they only live 15 - 20 years. Whereas humans require 9 months because we generally live 70 - 80 years.

Danae then took what seemed like a peculiar turn and said that when God made an angel, God put His glory on them. Unfortunately, some of the angels couldn't hold His glory without envy and attempted to take it as their own. Consequently, the angels who thought they could be God were cast out of heaven. Danae then said how when God made man, He made man in His image.

Danae continued that if we are to live for eternity, then we probably need a gestation period of 70 - 80 years to prepare us for it.

She concluded by saying that the sweetest thing about Olivia was that her heart was pure enough to only need two weeks on earth to hold God's glory safely for all eternity.

"I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us."
