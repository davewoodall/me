## Ruby

Control, but don't minimize

### Inheritance
- Benefits are modular code and code reuse
- Focus management
- Entropy management

### Polymorphism
Applies to methods and objects

### Encapsulation

### Code Smells
make sure you are not using class methods.
Try to marry a self.method to a new instance.

    class Foo
      def self.bar
        Foo.new('item')
      end
    end  

## Computer Science
1 process
multi-cores
threads are mini-processes


## Testing

Behavior Driven Development is testing an objects behavior, which is related to it's method passing.

Test that methods successfully send and receive

Test methods in a human friendly format, at different altitutes;
- Acceptance - If the stakeholder can read, approve, accept
- Integration - piece of systems working together at one time
- Unit - individual methods

BDD is
- given
- when 
- then

bdd is describing format of tests using 'describe', context, and strings
