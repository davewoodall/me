chat with joel glvoer about
- selling dev tees to swagbot
- being a designer until you get paid out
- the macro conspiracies
- pitch him LIFE print

Dave Woodall:
  i might have a lead for a buyer of devtees
  no.. haha i have a lead for a buyer.
  (I don’t _might have_. I do have a lead for you)
  owner of http://swagbot.com/ is looking to grow his business
Joel Glovier:
  lol that’s great news
Dave Woodall:
  also he needs some contract t-shirt design help? what would your sweet spot price be?
Joel Glovier:
  that’s a good question, and TBH I’m flexible. I think $30K would be awesome, but I could go lower. At some point though it’s not worth it to sell (would rather just hold onto the IP even if I just shut it down for a few years to revisit later)
Dave Woodall:
  let’s join forces
  i’ll handle the short term - everything except the design work
Joel Glovier:
  what do you have in mind?
  and what do you want from it?
Dave Woodall:
  nothing you don’t want to keep.
  wait
  or is it nothing you want to keep
  yeah. B
Joel Glovier:
  haha
Dave Woodall:
  this is a continuation from the above text asking if you’re interested
Joel Glovier:
  Depends. 
Dave Woodall:
  ok so maybe we need to get some facetime and we discuss? i am in all seriousness telling you, i have nothing shady in mind. only a WIN/WIN
  but i’ve been around a lot of shady people so i keep the cards close 😊
  or 😟
  i got this double talk theme going on today. my bad!
  the point is. i’m kind of a gifted deal maker
  and i can get people what they want
  and profit from it in a win/win way, not a win/lose wy
  and to summarize what I want out of this? I want to have my ‘eggs in lots of baskets’
Joel Glovier:
  Yeah, a conversation would be good. But the basics for me of what makes it a depends are: 1. how much of a sure thing it is (vs invested time/effort for nothing), 2. how much effort/time is required, and 3. how much you want out of it. If you can give me some pretty clear answers to those I can tell you pretty clearly how interested I am.
Dave Woodall:
  yeah thank you for spelling it out!!
Joel Glovier:
  👍🏼
Dave Woodall:
  let me read and get back to you on those then we figiure out go / no go
Joel Glovier:
  And to be honest, number 2 will be the biggest factor for me, as at this time in my life time/effort are the most scarce resource.
  Sure, that sounds good to me. 
  Thanks!
  Also, what do you mean that you “want to have your eggs in lots of baskets”? That sounds pretty hand wavy lol.
  i.e. I’m still not sure what you want out of it.
Dave Woodall:
  😊
  one of my many problems is that i don’t know how to tell short stories really well
Joel Glovier:
  hahaha
  that’s a fair shortcoming
Dave Woodall:
  either i give cryptic bad tl;drs or really LONG stories
  the problem is i think in such a broad way that my view ends up influencing the listener haha
  it’s a problem bc I really feel like i have know idea wtf i’m doing 😊 😟
  for example, i don’t really trust the goverment or the economy right now so i’m leery of what might happen to our day to days b/c I think that’s kinda near.
  and i just want to have some modern day ‘bartering skills’
  devtees is how i’ll survive the 2nd great depression 😊 😟
  so - of course our conversation can begin with ‘where do i get my information to draw such an outlandish conclusion?’
Joel Glovier:
  yeah, you are sounding crazier and crazier by the minute
  😉
  esp this:
  >devtees is how i’ll survive the 2nd great depression
  lolwat
Dave Woodall:
  that’s the cryptic tl;dr problem again
  i suck at shorties!
  wait
Joel Glovier:
  yeah, I figured 😃
  go on
Dave Woodall:
  ok yes i don’t know how to tell you that i’m a macro thinker at first.
  and where we’ll probably agree is the most macro conspiracy is that found in Geneses
  tl;dr’ed as ‘you will bruise his heel and he will bruise your head.’
  if we take the starting point of a cosmic battle then the next question might be, what / how does that play out on Jan, 21, 2016
  did the devil stop fighting God or is it still happening? b/c life sure feels pretty nice right now with dual screens, macbook, and this $600 chair. 
  so my last tl;dr is I think deep and long about a lot of things 😃
Joel Glovier:
  Wow, that is very deep, and yet still doesn’t explain anything. Are you high lol?
  Just kidding.
Dave Woodall:
  ha!
Joel Glovier:
  Tell you what, lets make some time for a call to talk through the details a bit more.
  I’d love to hear more about what you are proposing, but right now I’m pretty focused on getting some things wrapped up for the day, and then I have to get the kids dinner/bed/etc
Dave Woodall:
  i’m 38 and think very different than when i was young and an arrogant asshole
Joel Glovier:
  How about a day early next week?
Dave Woodall:
  totally next week is soonest!
  what about Friday next week so we can chill a bit?
Joel Glovier:
  Yeah, that could work. Later in the day would be best.
Dave Woodall:
  what about 4pm EST?
Joel Glovier:
  Perfect.
  Want to send me a cal invite?
Dave Woodall:
  i’ll send you some answers to your 3+ questions before then - to at least have a moving dialog
Joel Glovier:
  Excelllllent.
  
Dave Woodall:
  i don’t know how to preface this other than say if you feel like getting another angle to what i’m alluding to, i’ve been semi-blogging about it https://medium.com/sortpop-life/latest
  in closing. how much would this print sell for on etsy 
  
  spring lambs in a b/w shadow of death as said by psalm 23 in 1937, as told by LIFE
Joel Glovier:
  i’m not sure I understand the question?
Dave Woodall:
  ha! forget it
Joel Glovier:
  and I guess I have no idea as to the answer.
Dave Woodall:
  to be continued in long form
Joel Glovier:
  okay cool. 😊
  Thanks for reaching out. Looking forward to hearing more. You’ve certainly said some thing that really pique my interest (as well as a bunch of things that have totally thrown me for a loop if I’m honest).
Dave Woodall:
  the point is we’re internet buddies and you can never really trust people you meet online
  just invite me to your house and we’ll hash it out
  haha jk jk
Joel Glovier:
  hahaha that’d probably be much easier 😃
