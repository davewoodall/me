sure sure sure sure
put that on netflix
trying to finish my quiet time now geesh

"sure sure sure sure"
- i <3 huckabees
oh ha
bye spening time with the lord now
don't you want to know what he told me
go
i thought it was for the gym
coffee told you that?
I was praying and saying how I don't have the power to help anyone and
I feel like my life is sort of in a wasteful time.......not doing
anything for the lord or anything etc.....how I wanted to do big
sister but I"m thinking he didn't want me to.....feel like I live sort
of a bethlehem life...(small and insignificant) anyway he said that I
first need to help you..I need to give you the support (and my time
and energy and resources) that I want to give abused indian girls and
other needy helpless people, I need to give that to you then he will
take me to the next level after I master being your helper.....
humbling.
wow babes
ya I listen
save that
in bp
it's written down in my journel because thats where he told me
ha haaa!
NO your funny
I'm not documenting my relationship with the lord in BP
embrace your day and age
thats your idol
k
love you babe
day - bp
praying for you all day
age - 29
I'm your biggest fan and now supporter
babes i just read that again
and i totally agree
the Lord told me that about you 3 or 4 years ago
that my tithe is going to you first
AW!
seriously!
if there is any left over after i give to you, then we'll use it for
others
Oh wow!
(one of the practical ways it affected my life)
so sweet of Him!
and my ministry
first to you
wow so cool
if i have time after serving you
I didn't know
then serve others
me too then
but not leave that spot
and i was fine (at peace) with that
I guess he doesn't want me to foster, big sister or adopt just yet
it was up to him if he wanted me to have more influence than beyond 1.
me too!
so cool
I'm on it now and very humbled
and he said HR is his favorite
he's been humbling me a lot lately
WHAT EVER! LOL
gotta go now
xxoo
ok love you
love you
