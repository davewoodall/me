I never stopped to think about where all these thought originally came from. Where did I innately desire purpose, clarity, and understanding. At the time, I assumed it was because I was meeting immediate needs of food, shelter, adn clothing.

But now I see that those were just part of the journey to soften my heart and prepare me for what was really going to happen. That I needed to have experiences that moved me from luke worm, to complete confidence in myself so that when my self natually feel - I would lose confidence in myself.
