slackbot robot for these standups 

@slackbot at 1pm pings me and iterates over all 'in progress' tickets

## parts

1. slackbot will ping me at standup time (1pm) 
2. tickets get submitted to slackbot #channel
3. non-business manager can see the day's from an index view to provides a 'real time' progress report based on 'ticket numbering' like a PO system. (This is not an endorsement for jira)
4. at the end of the week - have a group hangout and confirm those 5 days of standup notes - the manager (pat) will say 'keep it up' or 'lets switch you now to a different _somethign_'

this is how to heard cats. programmers by nature have to possess an insatiable desire to learn and grow and find the new thing and tinker with an MVP to have the confidence to put it into a brownbag, which takes time to present, to get buy in from the team that the decision is proper - which takes watching lightning talks, which is management practice. So all of those things don't fit well into a 9 - 5. it's more like,

I'm not graded by what I'm doing, but how well I do it. Is it fast, helpful to the company, profitable like the above non-code examples that should also have tickets around them.

Then, a dashboard for kim, nick b, diwakar - the non-tech (and tech like chrismo) to get a real time pulse based on 1pm standup data.

[Merchant overview]()
[CSR]()
[Dave]()
[Week of]()

(Everyone gets slackbottted at the same time for the 1pm standup.)
- 90 out of 100 devs responded within 15m.
- 3 devs are PTO

Ryan can get a managerial view of what every single developer in the distributed company are.

Company policy
- 3 strikes on stand-up means fired.
- strikes are private marks for managers to keep tabs on each developer. the developer, while trustworthy can't be trusted in this particular situaiton, 100% of the time. hence, management has the ability to spot if a developer is gaming the system.
