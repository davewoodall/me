# Why Rails developers get paid more than WordPress developers

WordPress is a great blogging platform. But blogging is not how companies make their money. They make money from transactions, with customers.

Rails is a framework build for transactions. Businesses will gladly pay for talent that helps them make more sales.

You and your co-workers can update a wordpress blog, but your customers cant.

Rails allows you to have customers who buy your content, product, or service.
