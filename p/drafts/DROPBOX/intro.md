## Assumptions
you work a 9-5 job. You do it to pay the bills. You run other activities. You wonder where your time is going.

## Premise
If you were given a $100 bill. Would you prefer to have 1 - 100 item, 10 - 10 items, or 100 - 1 items. The idea around operating in this mentality is to help you understanding time sacrifices. and work toward a larger item.
