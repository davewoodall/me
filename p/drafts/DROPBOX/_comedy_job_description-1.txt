Comedy Job Description
======================

Rumor is you're funny. You say observations about life and people
laugh. You have a peculiar knack for describing situations that people
take for granted. You've said enough comical things that people have
actually hired you to write copy for their projects.

I'm looking to buy 10 - 15 great and funny statements about skiing,
snowboarding, and other mountain sayings.

I need original work and need proof that what you're selling me isn't
already protected.

Send me your rates and how I can buy good materials.
