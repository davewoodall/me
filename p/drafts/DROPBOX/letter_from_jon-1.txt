Letter from JOn
===============

Sweet ￼
Again sorry for frustrating you... You are a good guy and a huge
asset... I'm by no means trying to push you away, but merely trying to
do what I "need" to do to keep "futura" running... I'm not always the
"quickest" to understand a good idea or how to implement, but you
should know, for your part, I think you've been very good and
honorable... Thank you.

Let's move on...
I like Denver... But before you settle, I would rather consider the
springs? ...If that's truly where the "action" is, maybe we should
emerse you right in it? (I would prefer to anyway) - If we are going
to pay the expense to move you, might as well put you right there? We
can discuss...I totally understand on Danae, and believe we should
move right away on this... March 1 sounds good... I'll have to check
with my wife for helping... Should probably look at flying over there
and trying to find something...I love how close we could be and I
could have a good reason to drive down and Ski / vice versa...I'll
call in a bit.
-J
