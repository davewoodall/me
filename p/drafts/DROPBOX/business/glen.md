Hey Glenn,

This is a short recap but I am happy to expound if you so desire. 

Vision
Establish a transparent, open source communication culture that creates a mastermind of insight and input, from the trenches to the top, so that we can build a great company together.

Summary
- We in the trenches see and hear the good and bad from all aspects of the company including; Sales, Operations, Customer Interaction, Vendor Interaction, Systems Interaction etc. We also have ideas and thoughts about what we deal with.

- LivingSocial should create an internal forum for anyone in the company to ask, comment, vote, and propose solutions. Doing so will let the best thoughts bubble-up for leadership to determine whether or not to engage.

- Open communication from the field means those who deal with customers and systems can say what's really happening when leadership's plans (and products) see the light of day. 

- Fostering an environment of ideas will form a mastermind of people who want to see LivingSocial succeed. This is good for morale and a sense that we're all in it together.

- Open dialog will perpetuate a positive cycle where leadership's ideas request feedback. And that feedback will influence managements decisions. 






background

## Situation

I'm leading the Angular club and our current project is to rebuild the company Directory app. My recent task for the project was to consider what new features we might add. When I went and looked at the report I got curious about some co-workers. I realized that I don't know who my co-worker is or what they think, feel, or do with the company.

Other than pulse and corporate communication, I don't have a clear picutre of what's going on with the company.

- we have corporate communication
- how i feel 1 year in is I don't know what's going on
- I assume things are working but i don't know
- I'm happy as a developer but uncomfortable as someone who needs clarity 

- I went to a rockies game and hearing sales reps views of the company was fascinating and they were as excited to know us as developers
- A tool, like quandora makes this great because it is a way for people to openly ask, discuss, and support (or reject) internal discussion. I am of the opinion that having a virutal water cooler would foster ideas that would bubble to the top and management woudl have confidence to make informed decisions because they are ideas coming directly from the field.
- - Q&A in DC was awesome b/c it was unfiltered communication from people with real experiences
- transparency from the trenches. We need internal transparence for the team to help each other out.
- this is not asking customers for products, but having peopel who are pro-ls tell us what they see, think, and wonder when they look at LS's customers, users, merchants, accounts, finances, code, designs, workflow, and other parts of the company.
good for morale



## Problem
I don't have transparency or clear way to see or hear from co-wokers

## Implication
How can I make good decisions, ideas, or suggestions to help LivingSocial if we don't have proper context of what's going on? 

- I've ran two small businesses and in running them I need accurate picture of what's going on in order to make decisions. If I were a new ceo, I'd want to know what the people in the trenches are seeing. 

## Need Payoff
Imagine the feedback you'd get from people who have a solid hold on the pulse of the company.
