# Designing page behavior
The browser and CSS are modern design tools.  Both have made great strides toward interactive experiences. How can designers and developers work together to create content in new ways that drive interest, engagement, and sales.

## Examples
- attention getters (animations, alerts, transitions, fades)
- off camera strategies (hidden headers, sidebars, footers)

## Questions
Are we all on the same page of opinion and interest?
How do we develop modern user interfaces?
How do we communicate new tactics among the team?
How do we incorporate new concepts?

## Next steps
- Will talk with his team and gauge interest.

- PS - t-shirt (for Rocky Mtn Ruby) Will respond to email
