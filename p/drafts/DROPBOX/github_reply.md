Ticket #5 Need to get my account back
THE ONE WHERE I TEACH ..

> Hi, my name is Jorge,
>
> I'm the CTO of JorgeLLC. Last year, an now ex colleague, Fabian Freebird registered a github organization in name of our company. Mr Freebird has left the company in December 2012 and disappeared. The github organization is still registered on his account. So i would like to ask if you could transfer the organization to my account jorge2010.
>
>With kind regards,
>Jorge

Notes:
 
*  Looking at our admin view, JorgeLLC is an organization account with one owner -- freebird72
* Looking at the security history of the organization, the user jorge2010 was never a member
* Furthermore, the organization has never had another owner

GitHub does not change ownership of an account (nor will we transfer code) without a court order. This is for security reasons, to protect a legitimate owner from someone scamming their way into becoming the account owner. Also, it protects us from getting in the middle of a fight that we can't settle. We generally suggest two parties work it out themselves, since this results in faster resolution than going to court.

Ticket #5 response:
THE REPLY WHERE I SHOW MY SENSITIVE SIDE

Hey Jorge,

Ah this is such a bummer to hear. I actually had a similar situation once so, I know how uncomfortable this is. Be encouraged that cooler heads always prevail and if you have anything in writing with feebird72 about your relationship, then that should work to your favor. 

As far as my role and GitHub's role in this situation, I'm afraid this is where our adventure ends. But feel free to keep me posted as things transpire!

_ps - I'm sure he'll grant you access if you buy him/her/them/it a beer or two :-)_
