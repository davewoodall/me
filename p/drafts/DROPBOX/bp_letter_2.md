viva backpack!

Jason,

I am a guest in your house. I want to work on a product I love, with people I admire, in a lifestyle I enjoy, toward a mission I believe in. It is an extreme honor to be able to present some ideas around your products. I will spare you more of my fan boy comments and say that I’ve been a fan, customer, and student of your work since I first learned of you in 2007.

Think of the story that has played out between us already. In that year I learn of Ruby on Rails and Basecamp and proceed to build three separate businesses on top of your products. One I owned and generated nearly $5M in total revenue over the first four years in business. The other, I managed as an Art Director and rebuilt a bankrupt company’s design team and managed to do so effectively to support producing nearly 6,000 graphics in 2 years. The 37s suite as I refer to it benefited me tremendously before I learned how to code.

I abandoned all that in order to learn to code. My mentor DHH (David H. Hoover) wrote that it is better to be the tail of a lion than the head of a fox. I opted to learn to code because my bootstrapped business was not able to afford a programmer.

LivingSocial is a by product of what you built. By fostering the creation of Rails, companies like my former employer we able to peak at $1.5B in annual sales. The team of 150 engineers was assembled by some of the finest supporters of the Rails community. And now the majority of that cohesive, accomplished, and remote workforce are sitting idle, and mostly shell shocked.

I see a great opportunity to reconnect my worlds. To revive a product I still use today with a team who could be inserted and deliver from day one. These are people who run large systems, manage legacy code, and solve complex problems brought on by a business teams who have demonstrated they cannot turn the corner toward profitability.

Imagine the irony that the team that has been gone out and gained experience coming back to the origin and helping fuel your original vision of helping small businesses succeed. but more important than that, we have a chance to tell your larger story that starts with REMOTE workers and impacts the greater issue of employment. I can already see the third book in your series, the one that describes how a remote team banded together to rebuild a retired product to take on Evernote and other bloated software built without being profitable.

The beauty of what I’m proposing is that we have a varitey of options to consider. Be it a small, part-time team who need to subsidize income. Or begin with a small team covering the basics. Or enlist a larger sized team and hit the ground running with the new requirements of 2016 and beyond. What I want is to apply to join the team in whatever way seems best for success.
As you’ve demonstrated with Highrise, Starter League, and Know thy Company – there are many different ways to approach this.

Vision

My vision for backpack is that it continues down the dual purpose of centralized source of truth for a company while also maintaining it’s position as a single source of content for an individual, like myself. How this plays out in 2016 is a little different than in the earlier days. 37signals had demonstrated the ability for other products to integrate well with all three products but there was little intergration between the 3 apps themselves. I see a need for backpack to empower users to create forms and automate certain other activities that were previously left to copy/paste from one app to the other. I see backpack as the place to build forms, manage data, and export data as needed through API’s, webhooks, and user created forms that can be displayed on public pages and ported into basecamp, highrise, or back into backpack.

Plan

upgrades
maintenance, stability, monitoring
marketing plan
responsive
evernote port

As initiator of this plan, I would envision my tasks primarily focus on two tasks; Finding talent and earning a profit. 
Backpack comes into play as an existing product that could benefit immediately from an existing team capable of managing the entire stack and supporting requirements. Based on the volume, revenues, and need – the new team can be selected for ideal starting size.
h2. company structure
Neither of us have much to lose if this doesn’t work out. And I am not in a sense of urgency to force something that would go sour. I am exteremely interested but I am not desparate. There is no need to force something with a pre-mature commitment that makes you either party uncomfortable. I am not sure the state of BP’s internals so I can offer a wide range of options for company structure that I am open to. I would defer to your views and thoughts on what you feel comfortable with.

how it would work

As i have repeatedly stated, my experience is in bootstrapping businesses. I see no need to introduce gobs of funding with no clear understanding for how it will ROI. We can invest in the people and plans with high certainty of profitability.

Further, I can speak for those I represent that the team would assume so level of collaboration and synergy as a third member of the ‘launch bar’ we would hope to see opportunities to leverage the history while respecting any cultural boundaries the basecamp and highrise teams operate by.

Specifics would include us being responsible for marketing, featues, product roadmaps, bugs, customer service, HR, staffing, financials, server management, bugs, and trouble shooting. I could take the role of COO and be responsible to implement ideas that align with your vision or have access as you deem interest. At the risk of sounding cheesy, I want to help you expand your kingdom. What I want is to expand your kingdom. I want to continue your legacy. I want to be the proof that remote workers are the future. I want to rescue my favorite app, the only one I pay out of pocket for each month. I want to help people who do not realize they were left behind, or that technology has simply left them behind. I want to help the little guy. Backpack is such an app that is easy, efficient, and effective. I want to work with great people in whatever role I am deemed valuable.

Part of my due dilligence, I asked Nate for some advice and based on his comments and your previous blog posts, I would envision the business would ultimately run in the following manner;

Backpack will be a small, autonomous franchise, responsible for our own financial performance.

start game

1. team of part-time contractors
2. team of full-time contractor
3. employees
4. ‘owner financed’ purchase
5. raise funds and purchase

end game

depending on how we begin will influence how we end. But I would be willing to entertain any of the above to continue the conversation. I am committed to building a business with great people for the next 20 years and trust you enough to explore any scenario you are most comfortable with.

Impact

Backpack is a product that many people had come
