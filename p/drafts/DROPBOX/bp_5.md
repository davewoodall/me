Jason,

Jason, 

Thank you for being willing to hear me out.


What’s the vision?

*Establish A new team*

It goes without question that you could run backpack in your sleep. However, you've publicly stated that you have chosen to focus your efforts elsewhere. Backpack may be stable but it will not endure without attention. 

Backpack needs a leader I am applying for the position. LivingSocial's loss is your gain. I have a capable team of experienced designers and developers who would relish the task of making BP shine!

*Keep Backpack alive*

Backpack helped me build businesses and I want it to help me build more of them. While it needs to be updated for mobile use, and a new coat of paint would help, the product is still sound.

*Achieve a personal goal*

In 2007 I discovered Basecamp. It's simplicity, effectiveness, and business model fascinated me. I have wanted to run a SAAS business ever since and continue working toward that goal. 

Backpack's situation appeals to me because it's in maintenance mode, profitable, and popular. It compliments Basecamp and Highrise because it's focus is building company culture. I know how the product works and how to sell it.

*Pick a fight*

The current options to keep people connected is uninspiring. Evernote's approach is cluttered, bloated. Dropbox is great if it can ever finish  syncing. Confluence has so many layers that I avoid using it. People want simple and clean and Backpacks's flat approach to content is the solution.

*Expand your audience*

I greatly respect you and David. Your writings, software, and philosophy have influenced how I view business and leadership. It would be an honor to be affiliated with you and I would work hard to prove you made the right decision in selecting me to lead Backpack's renaissance. 

How would you see the company structure working?  

You have built, established, and released several companies including Highrise, Sortfolio, Starter League, and Know Thy Company. I am applying on good faith that you would be willing to explore something similar with Backpack and myself.

How would you see it working?  

I would assume leadership and be responsible to assemble the team and grow the customer base. Additionally, I would be tasked with managing the day to day operations that would include art, business, and code needs. I'd hope to structure Backpack as a subsidiary of Basecamp and follow a similar path to Highrise's return. I assume Backpack has no debt and has a respectable amount of paying customers who will fund the business. 

What’s the plan?  

Is backpack stable enough to reopen for business on day one or are there issues that need to be addressed first? My first task would be to gather as much context possible in order to understand where we begin.

Then, the short-term plan as I see it, would be to:

* Agree on a transition plan and time line.
* Secure the necessary team
* Determine mobile strategy
* Review customer feedback.
* Talk to a group of customers.
* Discuss the current backlog.
* Discuss the modern requirements.
* Establish marketing and branding strategies.
* Reopen as soon as possible.
* Consider new features after we are caught up.

Thank you for continuing to humor my attempts to keep Backpack alive. I look forward to discussing further. 

Sincerely, 
Dave
