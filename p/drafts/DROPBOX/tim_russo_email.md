Re: delay

Hey bro, 

I feel really bad at how long it has taken me to reply. I know you know how it is but I have wanted to write sooner. Life has a way of kicking my ass lately! But it meant a lot that you would ping me like you did with a jest about how long it has taken :-D

Anyway this email has comes 3 weeks after my '14th' prediction of a crash. While it didn't crash exactly as I expected - I'm still up. I'm planning on holding through October or if the crash happens, whichever comes first. There are so many macro trends going on that still have me believe we're near an economic cliff. To answer your specific question, the stocks I've invested are SDOW and SQQQ which short the DOW and NASDAQ indexes. I'm only do the stock stuff on the side and still writing code full time and still really love it. It's 1M times better than the christian music industry! haha

Over the past year I've discovered up many topics about bible, God, the world, and more that are easily labeled fringe and controversial. I'm reading a book right now called "Earths earliest ages" - written in 1876 and it's unlike anything I've read before. But all in all, these topics have added tremendous color to my faith and life. 

I've lost touch with Pete and for the most part, Aaron too. Before Olivia passed away I was in limited conversation with Pete and when we did talk it felt like he was just trying to win arguments. Then, when I lost Olivia he didn't come to the funeral and that kind of defined where we really were. So I just told him that I need to take a break. We haven't spoken in over a year. I'm not sure what Aaron's story is but I don't think he's fully recovered. When we do talk it's through text once or twice a month. I wish them both the best but life has finally moved us all into different places...

My Birthday is July 7 and I don't turn 40 for almost 2 years so there is still plenty of time before it becomes a reality. But it's a wish I hope to see become a reality!







Re: Stocks
The US market didn't collapse on the 14th but it seems to be more turbulent longer and 
Well, here we are nearly a month later.
I'm only doing the stock stuff on the side and it is for a temporary thing.  I can admit that things have not transpired to the day but they are still happening as I see things happening. There are two stocks I have that are stocks that inverse the indexes. Specifically SDOW and SQQQ.

re: 40 / bali


My birthday is July 7, so I've still got about 1.5 years before I hit 40. 

I've lost touch with Pete and Aaron and I will text occassionally about once a month or so. I think the thing for me is that the loss of my daughter really jacked up my perspectives on a lot of things. I'm having a difficult time spending a lot of time on the things that used to enterain me. 

I'm still coding full time and that's good.


Hey bro, I've just got back to bali after a pretty hectic few weeks stateside and canada cruising all over. It was awesome times. Are you sure that it's high altitude beer and not the recreational weed that's making you forget? I was in Washington and its recreationally legal there and I puffed my head off hahaha...it's crazy how u can walk into a store now and score chronic.

Congrats on baby Courage! I do believe you told me a while back that you guys were pregnant again, that's awesome, I can't wait to join the club :)

Thats some deep shit you write below about the parables and their relation to the stock market and life as we know it. How exactly did you choose sept 14th?! That's like less than two weeks away....can you give me some more time to prepare?

No but seriously, what stock market plays are you doing to earn that coin in two days? Penny stocks or something? I don't want to come across wrong, but be careful going for big gains in the short term...it's risky and unlikely to be sustainable....ya know? Give me an example of what you did investment wise as it related to a parable?

So are you just playing the stock market now for work? Do you still build websites and program?

It would be great to see you in bali for your 40th, when is your bday again? Crazy we will be 40 soon...u still keeping in touch with Pete and Aaron? I see posts from Aaron all the time but never anything from Pete...not sure why he doesn't come through my feed or he just never posts stuff...is Aaron totally recovered now or is he still at risk for that problem again?

Ok brotha, keep in touch. Tim

Haha... the funny thing is in the last few days you came to my mind and I thought "man, I should write him... or did I?" So, that goes to show you that high altitude beer and email don't mix because I can tell from reading it a week later that I was clearly in a good place hahaha

Congrats on baby man! Babies are amazing and I pray blessings on your pregnancy! We're in the life and times raising a 3 month old. I can't honestly remember if I told you we were pregnant. His name is Courage. 

Yeah 18 months have concluded in my closing the second, 19 year chapter of my life. Where, I'd say;
age 0 - 19 was aimless wandering
19 - 37 trying to make something of myself
38 + wilderness content.

I think the best way for me to describe it is as a parable. That life is like that of a banana. Each person goes through Green, Yellow, and Brown stages. Green we are getting ready to live. Yellow, we are at our peak of everything - earning, looks, health, wealth, network, energy, etc etc. People hit that place and think it will never end because it feels like that. But then one day you see a brown spot on your golden yellow skin. People cover that with new cars, boob jobs, and other means. But the reality is we are no longer at our 'peak'. That depresses many people. Especially those who have their entire identity wrapped up in what can be seen. 

But the loss of amb3r, harvard, olivia, and more have made me lose focus on this world. I've come to see that just as Danae sustained Courage in her womb, and Seewah sustains your little one in her womb until those babies were born. They were fully sustained by their mothers. But, we are to be born again, which means that we are in the 2nd womb. We are being formed for real life. And just as our mother's sustained us in their womb's, our Heavenly Father sustains us in this womb. It is not by me efforts that I survive. This is a genuine transition for me and probably because it has been my experiences.

As business and startup have wained I have started getting interested in the real meaning of prophecy. I've since learned that nearly 33% of the bible is about prophecy and has some very interesting applications. (In the past I had no time or interest because I didn't see those things as practical or clear) But now I see them in a new light and find their words very specific. So much so that at the study of those, I was ready for the stock market falls last week (and today) and have made $17k in the last two days :-D.  It's not so much the money that is what I'm excited about but that I was able to listen and act on what I was learning. Part of my 18 month change is also a new view about money (even though it's going to see a bit contrary to my actions in the stock market) I wrote this post 7 months ago but I can't remember if I sent it to you. These views have only gotten stronger; http://wwwoodall.com/blog/rejecting-the-pyramid-scheme. 

Have you heard of the blood moons, shemitah, or harbinger? None of my friends or even local church for that matter have so don't worry if you haven't. Basically, they are overlapping with a common theme that America is about to get judged and it's going to happen starting September. September 14 to be exact. 

I recognize this stuff is pretty outlandish but it has changed my faith in the ways 'religion' should in that I find myself seeking greater Holiness and less sin because I believe things are about to get real...

Lastly, I'm only 38 but Danae asked me if I wanted a big party for my 40th birthday. I tolder her 'no, I'd rather go visit Tim in Bali. 
So, if all is as it seems in 2 years, I'd love to spend my 40th with you :-)

Peace!
