——————

We’re in an era where you can easily take more photos and movies than your computer can hold. So, harddrives need to become managed properly or you just need to stop taking so many photos of your cute kids. 

Dropbox hit a level of 1TB which is a TON of space. They also have carousel to keep your photos organized so you can review them on a weekly basis.

So, I’m writing out my storage management system.

Dropbox auto Sync is not that awesome anymore so I’ve moved to manual process.
The key though is the manual needs to be minimal or I won’t ever do it. So, I’ve created a little system.

I love Dropboxes screen scapture feature but it stopped working. I can only assume it was because my files were taking too long to sync up.


Photo Management.
1. Image capture
2. folder / import. Sometimes what I’ll do is run a quick review of deleting the truly bad - blurry or black photos.
3. open up a browser and move those over manually.
4. delete photos from import.

Dropbox is able to review all your folders and move their photos to a single stream which is a really nice feature (screen shot)
