Assembly Member Terms of Use

Welcome to Assembly, a web site that lets Members submit concepts, designs, ideas, software and other software related projects to the Assembly community of users (the “Community”) for feedback and development. The assembly.com web site and its associated services (the “Services”) may be found at the domain and its related subdomains found at assembly.com (the “Site”).

The Site is owned and operated by Assembly Made, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its corporate affiliates (collectively referred to herein as “Assembly”, "us", "we" or the "Company"). By creating a user account and/or accessing or using the Site or by posting any content on the Site, you agree to be bound by these Member Terms of Use ("Terms of Use” or ”Agreement”). We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or delete portions of these Terms of Use at any time without further notice. If we do this, we will post the changes to these Terms of Use on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. If you have a user account prior to any such changes, you will be prompted to review the revised Terms of Use, and accept them, prior to logging in to your user account. Your continued use of the Site after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to abide by these or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to use or access) the Site or the Services. It is your responsibility to regularly check the Site to determine if there have been changes to these Terms of Use and to review such changes.

THESE INCLUDE VARIOUS LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS, AND A DISPUTE RESOLUTION CLAUSE THAT GOVERNS HOW DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED. PLEASE NOTE THAT BY AGREEING TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS PROVIDED FOR HEREIN YOU MAY BE TRANSFERRING VALUABLE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO ASSEMBLY FOR ITS COMMERCIAL USE.

As a result, Assembly has very little control, if any, over the quality, safety, morality, legality, truthfulness or accuracy of Member Content provided by Members. Nonetheless, Assembly shall have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor and/or limit any Member Content posted by a Member to the Site, including, without limitation Software Products.

Arbitration

Except for either party’s claims of infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, any and all disputes between you and Assembly arising under or related in any way to this Agreement, must be resolved through binding arbitration as described in this section. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly. It includes, but is not limited to, all claims and disputes relating to this Agreement.
You agree that by entering into this Agreement, you and Assembly are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action. You and Assembly agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Any arbitration will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this section. For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, the AAA, you and Assembly must abide by the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions; and (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. If the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA rules, and the hearing (if any) must take place in your choice of the following locations: San Francisco, CA, Denver, CO, or New York, NY. The arbitrator’s ruling is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event this agreement to arbitrate is held unenforceable by a court, then the disputes that would otherwise have been arbitrated shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California. Claims of infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall be exclusively brought in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California.

Miscellaneous

This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred by you, but may be assigned by Company without restriction. Your access to the Site as well as the terms and conditions and the agreement they create are governed and interpreted by the laws of the State of California, other than such laws, rules, regulations and case law that would result in the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than the State of California. Company’s failure to enforce any provision of the Terms of Use shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision nor of the right to enforce such provision. If any part of the Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Terms shall continue in effect. A printed version of the Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
