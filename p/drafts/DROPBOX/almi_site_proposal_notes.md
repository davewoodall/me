Hannah,

Good catching up. To summarize There are three areas I'd like to see adjusted before I consider 

1. billing
I think it's perfectly valid to say you would rather pay hourly (at $150 hr) than agree on a flat rate. That way you don't feel bad for requesting changes and you can also know how much such changes are costing you. 

Also, since tasks are managed my Trello tickets, those tickets should be specific enough to have billed hours aligned with each one. Financial should not be a dark surprise.

2. process
We would like to request some changes to the process. 

Step 1. - user stories
The first step should be defining user stories. Those user stories should explain all the interactions that our newly targeted users will interact with.

Steps 2 & 3 - low fidelity sketches & sitemap
Upon approval of the user stories, we want the second stage to be low fidelity sketches to ensure that the workflows are accounted for. This can happen before or after the site map phase.

Step 4. - style guide 
We would like to establish the styleguide before the wireframing.

Step 5 - wireframes as proposed

3. workflow
Since we don't know each other, rather than agreeing upon a single process, I'd prefer we break the project down into logical phases. 

phase 1. Preliminary
- user stories
- sketches & site map
- style guide
(payment for these services)

phase 2. Design
- wireframes
- prototypes
(payment for these services)

phase 3. Development
(payment for these services)

4. Examples
In all the proposal I do not see reference to any examples for the process. I would request some examples to be able to see a 'concept to completion' approach to make sure you see that what they start with is similar to what they deliver to set proper expectations

5. timing
Project has a window of 640 work hours (Sept 1 - Dec 31) but the $14,000 budget (at $150 hr) is 93 hours of work. That feels like a long stretch. 
I'd advise that the project has a timeline that is 3x, 4x MAX. Rather than 7x which risks the project getting stale, forgotten, or interrupted. Once work starts it needs to be completed much quicker.
