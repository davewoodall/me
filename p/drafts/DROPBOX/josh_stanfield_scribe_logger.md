# assignment...
show Gricia how we plan to import it.

1. determine the data and types
2. figure out where i'm going to put it
3. build the logger object.
4. scribe loggers.


1. create a logger. 
  CommentLogger = ScribeLogger.for('hdfs...')
  once my logger is created i can start to push data to I11
2. keep my data clean and make safty notices on to_s and to_i if & when possible.
