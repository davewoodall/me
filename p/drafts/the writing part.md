# the writing part

Let me get this out of the way because I have to. This post  feels like I'm the town drunk returning to confession explaining how this time it's different. Only my sin is my lack of blogging. I have made a commitment to blogging more times than I want to admit. But here I am again!

## This time it is different. 

Rather than bore you (and myself) with past reasons of falling off the wagon. This time I'm going to explain why I think this time is different.

- separate the parts
source docs are just for me
writing is not blogging, or post-production
content gets published

- tools
Paper

IA Writer
Everyone needs to find their favorite writing tool. For me, I've found IA writer and it works. I love that is opens and I don't have to configure to 'save' or where to save. I love that I easily can search inside this folder to find the text I've been working on before just starting another document. (for example, I knew I had something about IA Writer but I didn't know which document. I searched and found this section)



Rails


- margin
Lastly, for a variety of reasons I now have time to write again

- motivation
I want to write for myself and my sons. I want them to know some things which I know. And just because I think of the subject/idea today doesn't mean they are ready to hear it today. So, I'm going to write primarily for them. Hopefully they choose to read it but they can't if I don't write.

## Know my boundaries
I also want write so that I can review. I want to know what I know and have a firm grasp on what I know. Rather than not really knowing what I know. Know what I mean? I recognize it takes time to learn things. It takes even more time to know things well. To know them well means making it sink in by engaging with the subject. Be it note taking, presenting, teaching, and reviewing. I would rather know one thing really well than 10 things poorly. I recognize that sometimes that can't be the case. Or that the 'one thing' is really thousands of little things. At this current stage of my life, I want to know two things - The Law and Code. One eternal thing and one temporary thing.

Or maybe I want to know one thing per 'category'. What are my categories? Myself, my sons, my work.
