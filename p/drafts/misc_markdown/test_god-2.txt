Test God
========

I want to test God. I mean I want to try out some various beliefs and
see where my faith is small. I want to see Him everywhere.

  * Surprise me for 30 days
    I believe that no day is wasted. I believe He uses every moment.

  * Use the power of God He’s given me freely – time, health, solid
    mind

  * Accept that He is right here and He’ll move me where necessary

  * Walk by faith in my desires

  * Believe that I am where I am b/c of my own (lack of) efforts, and
    if I want something, all I have to do is take it.
