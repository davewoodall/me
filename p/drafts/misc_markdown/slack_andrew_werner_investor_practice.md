okay can we practice something i honestly need practice with?


which, i think will be mutually beneficial


in the form of ​_role play_​


seriously.


Let’s practice making deals.


me from the side of a small internet savvy 1099 business owner


you from the investor / lender point of view


and i will help you flush out the kinds of questions you should interrogate small business investements with.


and how to read my financial proposals - as i learned from my masters classes

## Andrew Werner
investor / lender meaning you're wanting investment to fund something you're looking to do and my interest is only from a percentage return capacity?


like i lend you money in return for money later or I lend you money with the intent on part ownership of what you're working on?

## dave woodall 
your call man. i just need funding


lets discuss terms, conditions, principal, interest, and whatever else

## Andrew Werner 
so this is a hypothetical conversation based on a real idea you have right?


How much do you need, what do you plan to do with it, and how will you re-coop my investment?

## dave woodall 
exactly


so are those the only 3 questions you have for this investment pitch? we'll id it as (1)


lets say you only get one shot to ask questions, then you have to either counter, accept, or pass

## Andrew Werner 
I think that's a good starting point and the areas I would be most interested from an investment standpoint


I don't think if you answered those three things well I would need more information... I mean other than a broader understanding of what the product or idea you're working through is... but if you gave some background of that in your response for question 2 that should work


I mean, there would probably be sub-categories within each question... Like in addition to understanding how much money you would need I would want to understand the terms of the loan/investment... unless that's something I would respond with in an offer...


but i think if it was a counter, accept, pass situation you would have to identify specific terms along with your ask of the investment.

## dave woodall 
yes to all of the above


i want us to sharpen each other to become funding / investing / startup badasses

## Andrew Werner 
actually, before those questions could be answered I guess the more important question is whether or not you have the ability or credit worthiness to separate me from my money... like you can say you can do the things in question 2, but how do I know you have the ability to follow through...?

## dave woodall 
boom see


so maybe you start with the ball busting up front


scare off or prequalify

## Andrew Werner 
right

## dave woodall 
with amb3r, it was 3 questions. if you couldn’t answer these, i knew it wasn’t real


which were - quantity, due date, budget


b/c everyone can ​_easily_​ do first 2


so when i press on budget and they haven’t even calculated they are about to spend the price of a business class plane ticket - i know it’s not real


even if they say below i can always counter and go from there


you say $5 each and i say ‘yes no problem for my cheap or $3+ for the nice cotton'


and they buy the $8 shirt 80% of the time

## Andrew Werner 
you're saying when people came to you wanting to purchase?

## dave woodall [4:30 PM] 
right
