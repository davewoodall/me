Hmm... I don't mean to nitpick but let me be honest so that we're not just rooting for our CEO's 

When he makes a statement like 'We built this place for you.'

How biblical is it to make church a place for non-believers?

How is this different than me sharing something about GT's accomplishments?

I do like that as troubles come - people find Jesus
