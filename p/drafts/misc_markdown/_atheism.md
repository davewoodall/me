# The tactics of an atheist

## Intro

When you get into a discussion with an atheist, you will notice they will tout the sound bites of all the majors. They have done a broad search in their quest to align their intellect with their emotions. They look in philosophy, science, and the world around them.

But if you take the time to listen, you will notice that their frame work is a collection of clips, and snippiets they are trying to piece together.

## Bait and switch
Reason i bring this up, is you have to be careful because they will change the subject when they run out of material.
First, you start talking about one thing, then they switch to pain and suffering.

## Magical beginners
A typical beginner operates with a posture of humility a "This is what I'm learning, but I don't know it fully yet." But It's odd that atheists in their initial search begin with such conclusive positions and attitudes that some how they have cheated the learning process and know so much.

Depending on the stage of their search, will depend on how much they will portray an image of superiority over you. Part of that posture is to look down on people who would be so silly to talk about a god.

### What counts as evidence?
They will say they only believe in what they can see. That sounds nice but it isn't true. They also believe in imagination, intuition, love, hate, and phobias. Some people have these things and we accept them as true.

They will use philosophy, theory, psychology in their debates but when you discuss the idea of 'supernatural' apparently that topic is not a real topic.

How about their own lives and relationships? Sure, at surface everyone is happy but how do you cope with life?

## Scientific method
We all can agree with the scientific method. What's odd is that atheisits don't subscribe to their own. Instead, they will use stories (theories) and think those answer questions. While I'll agree that the bible has some big stories (noah, joan), these are not any more spectacular than some of the theories atheists will believe. Interesting to see how we both arrive at the same live approach - taking a story by faith...

### Logic Extrapolation
Just because an atheist answers your questions on the supernatural with terms like. 'logic and reasoning' doesn't mean they are doing so.

Statistics tell you that once you extrapolate, you are beyond the room of reason. If you are aware of extrapolation, you will see how often that atheist will use it.

Definition of extrapolation;
Extend the application of (a method or conclusion, esp. one based on statistics) to an unknown situation by assuming that existing trends will continue or similar methods will be applicable.

Extrapolation is not logic.

### the bible
They also try to bring up the bible. But the bible doens’t prove God. The bible is a document that affirms what you already know and believe in your spirit. That christ, character, wisdom, truth, love, patience, are real. And that wickeness, the deparvity of man, and sin are real and bad too.

### Their trojan horse
The trojan horse is evolution. If you can start there and say it contractics with scripture, then you can be mislead to beleive that all of science is in question. Two problems with this; first evolution is just an idea that someoone has concocted in the way they try to make shape of the cloud into something. People who study evolution are using their imgainagion. Choosing imaginztion over fatith.

## Up is down
They love to blur the lines of theories, evidence, facts, and laws. If they can confuse you on this, then they can have you question your own sensese. Their favorite one is to use gravity and say if we can call it a theory, then we can call this theory a fact.

### Science
Also know that science itself says it can’t speak to the topics of supernatural. But, atheists will try to tough ideas as evidence. They also hope hide behind your ignorance, they hope that you will accept them ‘theory’ as ‘fact’ and they hope to convince you that ‘laws’ are ‘opinions’.

### Other religions
All religions are the same. Religion is man's attempts to reach God. There is only one time that God introduced the path to him. It does not take a missionary to take the message either. God is written into the hearts of every man and woman.

There are plenty of people who label themselves Christian that are not going to heaven.
Just as there are plenty of people who do not label themselves as Christian who are going to heven.

Team names are not the point. The point is where do you place your faith that all will be righted in the end.
Are you relying on your efforts, or God's for your relationship with him.


### In the beginning...
Lastly, have an unseen sence of entitlement in their arguments. They assume all these living things just appeared here.

They will use a tactic like radiation and then when you drill down on it, they run to the next topic, or make a joke.

## How could God...
Once you get to a layer, you will find the common question they all struggle with. "How then if there is a God, could he allow this pain or that suffering?". Bingo.

The struggle is that they cannot accept that a loving God would exists if there are so many points of pain. Probably several of them the atheist has struggled with as well.

It's a question for another topic and here is how I view it. [in the hour after]

### My therory.
Let me do some scientific theory of my own. They use atheism to answer a personal pain in their life.

They are mad at god. Could be becuse their father treated them wrong, or they experienced personal abuse. But how can a loving god do that to them.

So, they set out to confirm what they feel.

The second thing, is Darwin’s motives are in question. He lost his Daughter like I have, and soon after that went out to vent his pain into a logical reason.  So, as is with most atheists, they will move their questions of God to move into his actions and wonder how there can be a god if he allows the pain.

It would be more honest for them to say,
"I am mad at you, God. I got hurt and you did not protect me. I can't understand how a loving God would let me go through that. You must not be real because I would never let those I love go through that. To me, your silence is proof. Please change my mind."


You can't truly see the emptiness of following a false belief until you know someone who holds it. Their lives speak louder than what they tell you.

### The solution.

Do not feel that if you only had one real zinger, they would be converted. That is not the case. Ironically, when people dwell in the topic of supernatural, they are on an active quest. It would be more concerning if they refused to talk about that and opted for legos, or other non-spiritual issues.

Love and live with them. They need to experience days, or decades living in their own system. In the end, we will all stand before God and it is not our responsibility to do anything but respond to the Lord.

And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. 4 The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
2 cor 4:4

The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. 11 For who knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. 12 What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us. 13 This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words.[c] 14 The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. 15 The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments, 16 for,
1 cor 2

### Facts & figures
Facts, figures, debate and points never win a soul. Do life together and let their search be apart of your own. You can learn a lot, as I genuionly have about my own faith from hearing theirs and attempting to voice my own.

### As christians, we...
As Christians, let us know that we have no power anyway. We are availalbe, but at the end of the day the Holy Spirit must approach each and everyone individually and reaveal himself to the soul
