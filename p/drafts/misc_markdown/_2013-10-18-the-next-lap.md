I just launched [my first web app](http://www.destroyalltasks.com). It's a personal milestone that embodies my reasons for becoming a software developer and also validate a sense of progress toward becoming a developer.

I like to think of learning to program as taking laps around a track. In my mind I've completed two laps so far.

1. Get my bearings
2. Launch something
3. become full stack
4. hone the craft





Launching marks the completion of a lap.

I'd consider the first lap was when I began to realize that the Internet is here to stay. When all my attempts to outsource, hire, partner with developers were failing and I needed to begin to learn myself. I spent probably four years in this space. That lap ended when I realized that I cann't rely on anyone to achieve my dreams. I needed to learn to code. I wrote a [similar post](http://blog.woodalls.me/post/39145050426/what-is-web-development) about 10 months ago.

The next lap was what I called landing on ['ellis island'](http://blog.woodalls.me/post/33845811278/code-academy-is-my-ellis-island). A discover of languages, cultures, tools, technologies, and overall bearings. That time was filled with questions that included;  _is all this time and pain really worth it?_  _should I be learning to code?_  _what is the environment like?_  _how do I read errors?_  _how should i formulate questions?_

## Selling the mills
I had to wrestle with quesitons that were related to returning to my old career options or forging ahead. The biggest thing I needed was resolve, determination, perserverance, and faith that it would eventually make sense. For me, I was somewhat forced into the job and didn't have options to quit. I think it helped when I had felt that I had no choice but to learn it. I love how built to last describes it as 'selling the mills'.

## The next lap
Now, I'm focused on improving the quality and organization of the code I write. Incorporating best practices. This lap is great because I now have something tangible and I'm working within the four walls, as opposed to haveing to define those four walls. So, for the next 12 months, my focus is on expanding my rails experience into larger applications. Test driving my code. Writing Javascript. Now that I have DAT, I plan to use it as an example of developing sound practices, learning new techniques,

Because programming is so technical it is viewed as a negative. However, the benefit of that is it's easy to track progress. If you can produce functional software, then you are making progress. Lap two is building the concepts learned.

As I turn my attention to the next lap, I find that I'm drawn to learning Angular because I want more interactive compontents at the finer detail. I personally feel the cost of a page refresh for something the resets the entire page for a simple component. A true web app needs to keep it's position and be adjusted at the same time.

## Questions for this lap
I feel like I am charting my own path as an aspiring Interent Entrepreneur. The path includes learning to code and figuring out ways to apply it in entrepreneurial situations. I am well past the question of whether learning to code is the right approach. Not only do I love it, but the demand is only growing. I didn't think it would require as much technical learning but it has been a pleasant surprise as I make progress. _Is this the view?_ _How should I determine priority?_ _What is a good schedule?_ _What are driving core values? (Performance, UX, Users)_

### Managing a web app
As I grow into the dat, I'm getting to learn how to building vs. maintain. Maintaining is the real work and helps develop habits of fixing bugs, and developing the ability to code on projects that are not sexy.



As a web entrep, I feel my commitment is to three layers on the technical side;
- the design - ux/ui
- the backend - database/server
- the interaction - js/events

My first pass included
- html / css
- rails crud
- learning ruby

my second pass includes
- learning javascript
- crafting software
- incorporating testing
- modular scss
- forming a new learning schedule
