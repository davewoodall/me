Magic of Thinking Big
=====================

Chap 13 Leadership

Rule 1 : Trade minds with people I want to influence.

Consider that the vision I see is not clear to those who I have to
lead. They may not be interested or have aquired the idea so I need to
share the vision. If they had it, then they would be inspired and
leading the charge.

What are ways to help show why...
Develop context
Develop contrast
Cultivate mutual incentive
Think about what are their current interests.
Think about what are their fears.

Ask the question "If I were X, I would be thinking about..."
Speak to them in terms of what they are thinking.

This takes time and preparation to chose the right words and angle.
