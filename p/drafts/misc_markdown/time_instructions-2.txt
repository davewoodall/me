TIme Instructions
=================

1. think what you want for 30, 60, or 90 days
whatever is clear to you
TOOL: sketch pad

2. Make a general list of the categories important in your life during
that time.
(Example: School, Work, Home)

3. breakdown those categories into activities
School : Study, Class,

4. Prioritize:
Ways to do it:
consider when you would normally do those things: morning, day, night
Level of difficulty
level of importantce
Due date
Costs involved

5. put time needed on those activities

6. calculate that and make sure it’s under 100 hours
(which it will be)
put those into hour hour ‘time bins’
so for example ‘class’ is 2 hours
or let’s say 1 hour
then make 2 ‘1 hour’ time bins

6. Make Time bins – post it notes, or whatever.

then we move to ICAL
post those 1 hour time bins where they need to go
and on ical – hit ‘repeat until’ your 30,60, or 90 day mark
then stick to that schedule and if need be, come up with consequences
if you don’t
