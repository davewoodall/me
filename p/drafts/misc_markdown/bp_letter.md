Jason, 

For the past two years at LivingSocial I was I could while writing code on four differnet teams. LivingSocial was a collection of nearly 70 different Rails apps, built by 170 engineers over the course of 9 years. I worked on four different teams with some extremetly talented individuals. At it's peak, LS was generating upwards of $1.5B in revenues but has yet to turn a profit. The company is also the most funded venture out of DC according to CBInights. It was a fantastic opportunity to get a glimpse of what a large scale app looks like. This makes Code my 5th vocation and the one I've spent the past Four years focused on. Some might consider my variety of jobs as an inability to commit, but I feel that it's been on a long term journey of CEO in training. I was a ceo of an 'old world, bootstrapped company' but I realized that I wanted to join the internet and started over again. I know enough code to continue this path and it is the vocation I will reamin until I am able to run a company again. 

There are three primary reasons I want to un-retire backpack;

## I love the product.

Nothing compares with it's simplicity, clarity, and effectiveness to keep me organized mentally and professionally. 




## I want to expand your Kingdom.

I greatly respect you and David. I have read a significant amount of your collective writing and listened to many of your talks. I believe in your views about business, leadership, management, and software. I want to be apart of expanding your influence and continuing legacy.


##  It's a SAAS collecting dust.

Basecamp was my first exposure to software as a service and since then it has been my goal to own a saas business. Backpack is in tact and needs a leader to run it and I am requesting your permission to continue your vision.

## Vision

My vision is to pick up where you left off. Your decision to focus attention on Basecamp meant Backpack no longer received attention. And still, no one has picked up the baton. I want to be tasked with helping small businesses and people stay organized. 

Evernote fosters bad habits of digital hoarding and then taxes the users time with layers of folders and tags. Backpack is _still_ beautiful because it's flat design. "Flat" in terms of a flexible sidebar means that important content is one click away and the 'Action Bar' let's me build a page without leaving my train of thought. Backpack can compete against all note taking apps and win because reading, writing, and organizing are clean and easy.


## Structure

I assume you're asking about ownership and I must admit this is the part where people think I'm crazy for even asking. But I've seen how you worked with Highrise, Starter League, and Know Thy Company. This entire plan is based on good faith that you would be willing to explore something similar with Backpack. 

If I may deviate slightly and say that Backpack has some dust on it simply due to lack of attention. It speaks volumes that you are able to have a successful business run on auto-pilot as it does. While it is not considered a turnaround, I believe it will need some assistance before it can stand on it's own two feet again. And these are my favorite types of situations. I was hired by a PE firm who bought a bankrupt company and asked me to rebuild their Art Department. I managed a team of 9 artists on the '37suite' and two years later we won South Denver Small Business of the year. 

## How it would work

I would assume leadership and be responsible to assemble the team and grow the customer base. If Backpack were to become a second subsidiary then, to paraphrase your [blogpost](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3770-big-news-for-highrise), Backpack would become its own company, a subsidiary of Basecamp, with own team, board and budget. I assume Backpack has no debt and would be able to be funded by customer revenues. During the transition period, Backpack would lease some infrastructure from Basecamp, but ultimately itâ€™ll be completely self-sufficient.

## Plan

As far as the plan goes, if we started tomorrow, I would focus on the following, in order;

- Secure the [alpha team]()
- Agree on a transition plan and timeline.
- Determine the best course of action for a mobile friendly UI.
- Discuss the current backlog.
- Discuss the modern requirements
- Turn the lights on as it was before retirement.
- Handle [small improvements]
- Then, after our confidence is built, would we discuss [my wish list]
