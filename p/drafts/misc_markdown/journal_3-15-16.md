Just spent the night with the Trotters. I find it strange how much I have struggeled in the foyer of life. It took me nearly 38 years to find a 'desk job' that I enjoy, pays well, and is in demand. I was asked to take inventory of the Boulder office's equipment for livingsocial. I'm torn because I question how throuough I should be with that. part of me feels like I deserve to keep that equipment instead of being enticed with empty 'stock options'. But that's the strange thing about my life. That LivingSocial is falling apart while I'm leaving this house; while I got kicked out of cornerstone, while danae is gone. There is nothing left in BOulder to keep me. on top of it, I'm sick of no rain and these damn wind storms. I feel though that I'm about to experience a few months of life the way I did when I lived withmy parents in virgina in 1998. I experienced sort of a personal renessiance period. I was doing landscaping, church clothes, reading, and changing my life. What hurts is to think that the only reason I'm currently interested in returning to dane is for the boys. not her.

She is unstable and i gave her a taste of her own medicine and in her short term memory, thinks I'm the catalyst rather than realize that in my 13th year, I signed up for 2 cards in her name, to support what seemed like a family plan of survival. where did I come up with 'end of the world' scenario? From her. I admit I took it and ran with it. But what does that say about the state of my relationship with her that somehow she and I are not even connected on how to address common subjects. Or how about christmas. is it a pagan holiday or not? we say no but then she goes back on that and i'm the bad guy for DOING something with those talks. We discussed it being pagan so i tossed it all and she's upset with my actions - AND that I didn't talk with her first, which is what I have been living with her and she doesn't like how that feels.

- credit cards
- christmas
- plans without communication

not even my kids are keeping me with her. I love those boys more than anything but they cannot keep me with her. They will not be the first to have a rocky story about their parents.

I realize and can admit that i'm stealing $5k in equipment according to some. But from my point of view, i am simply being compensated in a real means. For, the options they offered me are worthless promises from a crooked company. i prefer to be paid in barter because your money claims are worthless. I would rather take the risk that your profitless, illegal  company won't pursue me than 

If we have a daughter she will be named Darley. Because she was a miracle that was birthed on a broken road.
