# Web_development

Web development is a combination of hard and soft skills. It requires many hats, angles, thoughts to be successful. Here is my list so far. I will attempt to organize these by hard and soft skills. Hard skills defined as non-people focused. Soft skills being the interactions with people. The relationships.

## Hard Skills

### Data
This is the valuable content that is what brings people to your domain.

### Storgage
This is the database layer. How content is stored

### Security
Anything of value must be protected. This could mean from the public as well as internal with things like roles.

### Delivery
he web is delivered over http, web sockets, using formats such as .html and .json

### Languages
eb development does not enforce a specific collection of languages but a web application will ideally select one per usecase based on need. Be it Ruby, Java, Python, HTML, Javascript, Elm, etc.

## Soft skills

### Design
Design is the thought process behind decision making. How things look, sound, communicate. How things get accomplished.

### Staff
The staff who work in web development will vary by skill, interest, and loyalty. It is the job of the leadership staff to ensure the right kinds of people are working on the application. Those who work on this application need to be trained in it’s mission, philosophy, and processes otherwise people will unintentionally make a mess.

### Users
Users are like fish in a gigantic ocean. It’s not so much that they don’t like your stuff. Rather, there are plenty of competing hooks and feeding places to get a fish to swim elsewhere. Users are willing to try out services but they need to be respected with time, attention, and service.

### Vision
We have all heard that the sub-conscious mind works behind the scenes. Even when we’re sleeping. But it needs to be activated. Vision is how to invoke the sub-conscious mind. Vision is ultimately distilled into a road map. That vision might be 2 weeks or 2 years but someone needs to have a sense of where we’re headed. Someone needs to communicate that vision to the team in a way that invokes the team’s sub-conscious mind.
