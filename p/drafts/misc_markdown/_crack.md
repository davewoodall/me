Yes. You can keep smoking Crack if you want. (Grace Rom 6:1b)

If you haven't already realized, Your Christian faith operates on a different time table than the modern fast food mentality. The foundational truth I’m describing will take at least 6 months to a year to digest if you don't have this at the foundation of your faith.

There is a passage of scripture that is so key to the rest of your life, yet it is so commonly glazed over that people end up building their faith and actions on a faulty foundation. But it’s worth addressing since _the_ most important part of a building is the foundation.

<blockquote>"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?"</blockquote>

I can almost hear you answering that question from here. My concern is that because it _appears_ like the bible isn’t spending an exhaustive amount of time on grace you never stopped to recognize the deeper truth.

#### "That grace may abound"

Or, That the grace of God which is so powerful will be shown to eclipse any sinful actions

Have you accepted the fact that no matter how much you sin there will always be more grace than sin? That there is so much grace in the arms of God that you can literally do whatever you want and it will not affect the love and acceptance of God toward you. Yes, this even extends to practicing homosexuals and Crack smokers. I'm not joking. You can be a practicing addict the rest of their Christian life, and God would love him as much as he loves the non-addicts. That addict is free to do that the rest of his life.


(This is that point that you need to slow down for a moment, because you could misunderstand what I am saying if you have never grasped some of these basics.)

Let's pretend for a moment that like 1st and 2nd Corinthians, there is a 1st Romans and a 2nd Romans.
And that the one that happens to be in the bible happens to be "2nd Romans." Got it? Ok.

So I'm going to para-phrase a passage out of “1st Romans” (The one that didn't make it to the bible):

"As a Christian you began Your new Life in Christ born into a new identity. You did not get "saved" because of your performance. You yourself know that the message of Jesus Christ was so appealing because Jesus removed the very debts were in bondage to. You can never outlive  or out-do your identity. Just as you will never stop pumping the same blood as your earthly parents.
However, instead of blood sealing your spiritual birth, what binds our union with Christ is grace (Some may say love which is _also_ true).
There will never be a time after you are born-again where your performance will overshadow the grace of God.
The Grace of God is amazing and overpowering onto anything and everyone. (The questions of 'why' and 'how' are for a different discussion.) The first step is to grasp this reality. You are Loved by God and you have so much grace that you are free to live without the fear of God looking over your shoulder to make sure you’re living “His way.”

God loves you and his empowering freedom does not have strings or conditional requirements to hold the freedom He's given you.
Your identity is more important that your performance.
Only after you grasp it should you let Christ reveal the actions of life.  then you will be ready to understand that life is a Journey moving from darkness to light, foolishness to wisdom, and from Grace to Victory.

But God Loves you right where you are and even more so as a child of His. <b>He did not call you into his loving arms, only then to mentally abuse you with performance standards once you were His.</b> If you could have improved yourself, then you wouldn't have needed the help of God in the first place!
He loves you now and _JUST AS MUCH_ as he loves you when you will live in perfect light and wisdom.

So I want you to embrace the grace. The Lord loves you wherever you are and in the midst of whatever you are involved in. His Grace covers all sins and will never cease doing so. Don't believe the false teachers who tell you you are “re-crucifying Christ” when you sin again. They don't understand grace.

I want you to understand that you can do whatever you want. The grace of God covers you even to the extent of an ignorant and destructive decision. The grace of God is still there loving you. "

Only once that you grasp that should you read "2nd Romans" which then asks (paraphrase)

Even though you could sin and sin without relational or positional consequence (and as we learned God's grace will abound) is that why He did that?

Or is there a bigger lesson, but I just needed you to understand that the Love of God is just that. Love. His agenda is not one of making robots, but of you coming alive! But that if for another time.

Embrace the grace of God in your life. Do not back down or away from God <b>when</b> you sin. It is not your performance that holds you there to begin with. It is His grace that brought you there, and grace that keeps you there.

When you are tempted to withdraw because you think God is mad at you, think again. God loves you _the same_ before and after your actions.

There no reason not to Remain in Him.
