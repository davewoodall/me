# Systems

- Code School
I want to pick some subjects and drill down on them. That includes books, videos, writing, and some kind of deliverable

- Writing System
I want to go from draft to published. Currently, I have stacks of handwritten pages as well as these mounting drafts. I think that IAWriter has brought me closer but what is the next step?

- Bible Study
The things Iâ€™m learning in the bible are opposite of everything I learned the last 30+ years. I want to figure out how to study, search, and live according to these new insights.

- Production Studio
Production includes blog, youtube, and ebooks. I want to produce content for my professional and father roles.
