# Cutting edge or old school? (A vision for the local church)

_3/4/7_

I have a vision for a totally new and revolutionary way for Christians to gather.
But before you read it, read the 13 premises that have shaped my point of view:

1. The bible is not the Final Authority.
The Scriptures are a truth, a perfect truth. Exactly how God wanted them preserved. Total wisdom. I belive they are perfect in all their errancies. I believe the scriptures testify to absolute and eternal truths. But scripture not THE Truth. Christ is THE Truth. I know this may sound crazy if this is the first you're hearing this. But God spoke to men before the printing press and He continues to speak through more than the written scripture. Scripture tells us that Christ dwells in our hearts. He doesn't dwell in the bible. The Word became flesh. There are no passages that say He posseses the paper.

2. We are all unique.
The Myers Briggs personality test reveals that there are 16 different personality temperaments. In addition people have their unique pathway to God in how they worship and discover God. Examples include the Intellectual, the Artist, the Feeler, the Musician, and the Contemplative. Third people's unique history influences who they are. Their family structure, wounds and hurts, and their victories all play a part in their Journey. Fourth, people are at different stages in their beliefs. The spectrum goes from Atheists to Old Believers. New Believers, Young Believers, Broken Believers all meeting together. Lastly the church is a collection of people in all stages of life. Young, old, single, married, kids divorced, widowed, etc.

Which leads me to ask; What percentage of the congregation actually gets excited when the pastor says he's going to lead us all on 40 days of purpose? Does he have a specific group in mind or just a vague crowd who need somthing to listen to?

This ad is the perfect example. We're all approaching the same thing (God) from different perspectives


I love those guys! None of them them are wrong and the church should recognize that and embrace all walks. Not permit one to criticize the other. Why not nurture a body where we celebrate one anothers uniquenesses and discover God in the way He created others totally different.

3. We are the Bride of Christ.
If I made love to my bride the exact same way every time, how many times would it take before she would dread the next encounter? Is it possible I'm tired of meeting God "corporately" the exact same way for the last 20+ years?
We change every part of our life to keep it fresh and exciting except for the weekly church gathering.

Pop quiz: The common reply you get when say you're bored with church is:
A - It's the leaderships fault
B - You can't only be feed, you need to serve to make it better
C - You're a pagan
D - B &amp; C (Because it's never the leadership's fault.)

People say that they're church is so different. It's not. They're all the same. It's as if we're not allowed to do it any way else.
Every church follows the same general format; Sing 2-6 worship songs, 1-2 minute member greeting, 3-6 minutes of event announcements, a skit or song, and a 15 - 55 min message. Then you have the quarterly baptisms, communion, and committee meetings, etc. Some even do sunday school classes where singles, married, and widows gather for an hour to talk about their specific needs.
Why are all churches the same? Do we do church this way because it's the only way or because no one has thought to approach it a new way?
The point is variety is the spice of Life.

4. The physical building could actually help people discover God.
We know church is people. We hear all the time that the building doesn't matter, it's the people. If Church is the people, then why is it glued to the same weekly format? People need a gathering place. And a healthy church usually grows bigger than a home living room unless you're in China.
The problem is the physical building we attend is totally outdated. I believe it's hindering our discovery. The building is to be designed and structred to enhance and support the gathering of the people.
A proper church building will let the body meet and commune however they are led by the Spirit.

5. We live in the Information age.
I know a few people who like to reminis about the good days of Matthew Henery and company. How they knew God so well. Well I say that history is viewed with a romantic bent. Every day has it's pros and cons. Let's look at what we should do with what we have today. Let's not wish for other times, circumstances, or experiences. Consider the parable of the worker who buried his talent. He's the one who got the smack down. Let's not bury our talents by comparing our lives to others.
I love what Thomas Friedman says in his book "the World is Flat" "Why listen to a bad teacher when a good one is only a flat panel screen away?"

6. The purpose of church is fellowship. Not building something.
I am a total Thinker and Doer. I am all about projects and accomplishments. But as already stated, not everyone is created this way. The current structure of most active churches is promoting, motivating and trying to sign us up to some activity. I don't need more things to do. And not doing something doesn't define my spiritual state.
Church is a gathering of people who are coming together to Discover God from all walks of life. Everyone is at different seasons and stages. Every person needs something totally different at the same time. God wants us to commune because no one has all the answers. By fellowshiping with one another we find God. We discover what Christ has revealed in and through others about Himself.

7. God is already everywhere.
We're not taking Jesus anywhere He isn't already present. Psalm 139 confirms there is nowhere we can go that God is not. Why are churches sending missionaries? Is it because the people want to go or because the church thinks it's their responsibility and duty to bring Jesus to other parts of the World?

8. Culture is magnetic.
My best memories meeting new people are when I'm in a foreign country or rich foreign culture. Cultures have sights, sounds, tastes, and ideas that totally expand and enrich my life. The body of Christ is the same way. The body of Christ if full of culture. What if instead of trying to make everyone be like the pastor, we let each culture flourish and grow and teach us about their approach to God. A rich and healthy culture attracts people.

9. A living organism will grow.
When a body is alive there is no need to advertise on bilboards for growth.

10. People want to do more than watch paid staff do the fun stuff.
People want to talk, participate, use their brains, serve, mentor, listen, confess, pray, sing, commune, be advised, ask questions, give answers, collaborate, contribute, celebrate, and invite.
Church should be organized so that participation means more than parking cars and handing out bullitens. Another example: When people are in the true spirit of worship, they don't need professional singers to lead them. If worship is pure, people's eyes are off the worship team. Let any and all who want to praise, praise. This doesn't mean that everyone is the leader. It means there is no need to worry that bad performances are going to remove the attendees.

11. Life change happens in small, intimate environments.
If that's the case, then why have a big sermon environment? If you need an environment that is comfortable for new people, then make one. No need to bring all people into the "foyer" when only a small percentage need that experience.

12. We can do whatever we want.
In Christ we have total freedom. The way Romans 6 phrases it, one may think this freedom is simply NOT to sin.
But lets begin to believe that this freedom means that we can actually do whatever we want.
Does that mean we could paint and not read our bibles and God would be pleased with us living in our freedom? Hell Yea!

13. Sin is it's own punishment.
Sin is unnatural. We were not made to hold it. The eye doesn't need to be told that putting salt into it is wrong. It will quickly find out for itself. We don't sin because it is unnatural and wisdom teaches us that it will not fulfill any desire. It is not God's wrath that keeps us from sinning.
We do not need to waste time telling others that sin is wrong. They already know it. If your true desire is for them to know Christ, then spend time talking about Him and watch Life change happen.

With that stated, imagine a local community church like this. What if in the same 2 - 4 hour span you could have everyone totally engaged and passionate about discovering God, being together in fellowship, and loving their experience so much they insist on bringing their friends.

Imagine on Sunday 10 am you walk into a central gathering room. The environment is conducive to conversation with booths, coffee tables, nice lighting, music, wireless Internet, coffee and sandwich bar, smiling cocktail waitresses, and a hostess even there to greet you.

You are handed a bulletin. In it you find the schedule of events from 10 am until 2 pm.
These events are all going on at the same time. The bulletin is actually more of a menu in format.
On your menu you see there are 13 different activities that you can participate in to discover God however you want:

The menu would read:
Room 1. Worship 10 am - 2pm. Non-stop praise and worship. Sing as long as you like.

(Open to Jr &amp; Sr high)

Serve Trip: Going to local mission to feed the poor. Van leaves at 10:30 returns at 1:30

In addition, I see weekly small groups meeting, weekend retreats, and collective gatherings.

I wouldn't be suprised if people began requesting the church doors and rooms to be open more often than Sunday's.
If this church was to open it's doors 7 days a week, I would think it could become a hangout for mom's to bring their kids and a community center for teens for after school. Basketball, skate park, climbing walls, etc.

On Elders: I see that they would be at least 1 Elder per "room". He or she would be either directly leading that room, or Mentoring the person who was.

If Church were done this way it would be different each and every week. You may participate to learn. You may Participate b/c of a close friend wants to. But the point is we are discovering God together in the season and place we're at.
