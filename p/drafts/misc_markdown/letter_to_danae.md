My dearest Danae,

As I just mentioned in our brief facetime, this letter is written from a spirit of hope for us. My plans are to move closer to you physically, emotionally/mentally, and spiritually. I would request that you ask questions before concluding any sense of dire feelings about us. Please ask me to clarify things you do not understand because my heart’s desire is for us to win this war…

It has been five weeks since you left CO with our sons. I know these weeks have been very painful for you. The past few weeks have given me much time to think and pray about you, me, us, the boys, our present and future. As a result, I have made a couple of important decisions which I believe to be in the best interest of our marriage.

1. I have decided that I need more time apart to process our marriage, our pasts, present and future. I am not sure of how much time at this writing, but I know it is at least another month.

2. As a result, I have decided it is time to pack up and close the chapter of our lives in Boulder. I will be packing up our house and place our things in storage in Georgia until we decide what is the next best step for us. Mom and Dad have agreed to let me stay with them temporarily until we can discuss the future. This will give us a way to meet face to face while we seek reunion.

3. I know this may be very hard to read but it is where I am in our time of separation. I want to start over at the very foundation of learning what marriage is and how to be the loving, respectful, humble, and protective spouse you desire. I hope we can talk deep and at length through these things little by little as we try to move forward and toward one another. I am not going to rush this but will seek to move toward you until we get to the source of our disconnect.

I love you,

Dave
