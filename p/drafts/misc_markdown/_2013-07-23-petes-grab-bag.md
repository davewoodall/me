Take any backpack you have, preferably one with a rear load of pockets. It could be a cheap backpack, preferably not in a florescent decor of Flora. Make sure you like the zippers though because just like your pants you want that zipper north.

Moving on. Load it with food (freeze dried / canned) and a water filter. Any water filtration system is good and more than one is great. You body needs water like your soul needs the Spirit, for life. Remember, 3 days of no water and your heart stops.

Then, flashlights, matches, knives, fishing tackle, fire starters, multi-tool, cooking utensils, portable stove and fuel, maps, pen paper etc with whatever else.

The point is to load it for grab and go situations. Buy another piece to add each shopping trip.Put it in your car and forget about it. You're ready for something! What? Who knows, but you are now.
