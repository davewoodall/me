## Preface the prefaces
What is a preface but a way to frame the forthcoming subject. A preface helps the reader prepare for new information. If the preface is wrong then I suspect it taints the readers experience with the content.

This post is a preface. The first of a few prefaces I want to write. Others prefaces include ‘Preface to Prophecy’, ‘Preface to Israel’, ‘Preface to the Torah’, ‘Preface to Truth’, ‘Preface to the bible’, ‘Preface to Babylon’, and ‘Preface to manhood’, ‘Preface to me’.
