# Royal blood
People do not defend what they do not own. But why do I fight to keep honor, prise, respect, and followers? Those are attributes of royalty. What if we are actually royalty. But not in the way we origionally think.
I think my quest for purpose and significance is an internal one that was not unresolved by my parents. But the very reason I was brought to this Earth.
I needed to see who I am and who God is in order to be prepeared for my position in eternity. Just as a baby is not ready for this world at 5months along in a pregnancy, we are not ready for eternity until we spend time recognizing who we are in light of God.
