## 12/20 - Serving

Danae is sick with pregnancy and is very needy. She can't really do much as far as cleaning, cooking, and she needs me to fetch her food and other little things.
It comes all throughout the day and night.
Why I'm writing about it is b/c I don't like that inside, I'm so selfish, that I do these things for her with a begrudging heart. I am so wrapped up in my own work, book, world that it feels more of an inconvenience than anything.

I don't like that I don't like to serve.

Last night I gave up on my teeth. I can't think about them anymore. I and the Lord both know what I need and want. I have submitted the costs and timing to Him. If He wants me to have fixed teeth then He'll make it happen.

I'm wondering if buying out futureshirts would be something I should look into after school. Depending on how business is going and if the situation looks opportunistic I may consider it.
I still want to go to school though. I want to set roots in Denver and I want to learn / expand my horizons. I also am looking at it as a setup for the future.
Or maybe I start AMB*R design studio while in college... we'll do design and any apparel that won't fit the futureshirts budget.

>_Because thou hast made the LORD, who is my refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation_ Psalm 91:9

How can I remain in You? Is this acceptance that I am in You?

If I were to be able to describe myself internally and openly without reserve, I would say that I've always noticed inside that I had something  of an awareness and confidence that I knew more and could handle a situation better than the average person. However, I also found the topic to be fuzzy around the edges thereby making it difficult to attain and live out.
I think I've been quietly competing with my fellow man. Keeping the competition close to myself so that he will let his guard down.
I want to pray about that for a little while. Is this aspect of my soul a virtue or residue from being a fallen man?

>_Because he hath set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him; I will set him on high, because he hath known My name._ Psalm 91:14

While it's common knowledge that we learn through life, I don't think we fully realize that learning steps beyond education. Learning tends to be reserved for academic type subjects. But God has us on earth to learn some bigger and deeper truths. Including:
* His Unending Love
* His devotion and vast plan for me here and in eternity
* As He has purified us eternally, He is making that a reality on this earth as well

*suprise me Lord*
_12/16_
More so than surprises, I want intimacy. I want to be connected with the supernatural. Not because I need it, but because it exists and it's apart of me; and I of it.
I hope for a surprise from God today.

_12/18_
Yesterday I got word that sounded like we were going to lose this NAMB 17,000 piece job. But I was surprised when in the evening I got a email back saying they want us to put some art together for it!

_Father I want to know You. I want to know what the real deal is. Am I wasting my time with goals and ambitions? I am responding to the profound ideas you birth inside me. I have to state that I am, by faith, believing that that's how you speak to and through me. The board games, School pursuits, goals, etc._

Show me Thy ways, Teach me Thy paths.

*God has empowered me to get & accomplish what I set out to do.*

This is not what I feel. I don't feel accomplished and I don't feel empowered. I feel like I stepped out of line with this one. I would need some additional support and words from the Lord before I live in such a fashion. I want His will to be done. I have exchanged His life for mine. His agenda reigns supreme and I want to respond accordingly.
