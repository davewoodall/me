# Why Works Won't Work

_3/10/08_

It feels most natural to the common non-christian, and even young christians that, if there is a heaven, the way to gain entrance is by our good performance outweighing our bad.
This makes sense to those who don't know the deeper, however more obvouse truth that this earth is neither an accident or plan B.
Those who find works see us as separate entities from God trying to prove we are worth to be in His domain. Or at least avoid the flames!
But that is not reality. The truth is God holds everything and everyone together so much so that this life is the place for us to see that the power in us is from God and not of ourselves. 
It becomes clearer when you go all the way back to eternity past and see what happened in heaven when the less-than-us creatures didn't see that they were connected and sustained soley by God.
The angels were empowerd with so much glory and they ignorantly believed they could be the "Most High"
When Satan and all his minions were kicked from heaven, He's been the very contrasting tool to reveal in us this fact that God alone possesses all power. 
This concept of salvation is really the very first step, the most over recogniztion of this that I am not God and I am powerless without His involvement in my life. 

His mercy does not leave us at that doorstep. Once we acknowledge the most important truth, the details also begin to come into place.
