## Moving on

I want to get on with my life. The experiences of the past 3 years changed me to the core. During that time I was focused on the things of myself that were changing. I lost sight of the fact that there are parts of me that make me who I am. I’m a systems person. I want routines and predictability because the things in life that interest me are big. Even after all that’s occurred, I still want to build systems toward time consuming tasks. I want to do because it’s who I am, not because I want get somewhere.
