## 1/28/08 - The Lord has established it all.

"The world also is established, that it cannot be moved." Psalm 93

I have had thoughts that the news is really not that big of a deal. That only what the Lord wants will be established.
Word is coming out now that Iraq never did have WMD's and that the talks of Sadam were more of a threat to keep Iran at bay.
Then we come to hear that a 3rd world country, Iran, has potential for a nuclear weapon and we go up in arms and wonder if the world is going to end. It's a constant back and forth and it's a waste of time.

Lord, You reign Supreme and though the mountains may fall, You will remain forever. Though the world may collapse financially, physically, or emotionally, You remain secure. Let me remember that in all these days and distractions.
I Pray that You would be my messenger. That You would lead me to the NEWS and events You want me to be aware of and get involved in.

"who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should never be removed."Psalm 104:5

"He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle and herbs for the service of man, that he may bring forth food out of the earth," Psalm 104:14
* You sustain us Father. It is truly amazing Your love and master plan and design for this world. I can't comprehend the deep richness of who You are. What a wonderful God!

"O LORD, how manifold are Thy works! In wisdom hast Thou made them all; the earth is full of Thy riches." V.24

Lord how amazing You are. That all of earth declares Your goodness. You are faithful to all mankind, even those who blindly ignore You. My prayer is that You expand my comprehension and capacity for all the glories You have revealed inside and around me. Let me walk in the light of righteousness and wisdom. Let the wisdom be applied unto knowledge.
May the Joy of the LORD be my strength.

## 1/24

I want to capture everything You want to reveal to me. Wisdom, Truth, Equity, Righteousness, Life.

> "Thou art the same, and Thy years shall have no end." Psalm 102:27

Lord You are the source, reason, and power. You have great plans for me and I want to align and prepare for them.

Create in me a clean heart and a pure, meek spirit.

---
Father, I believe there is an intimacy that accompanies the trials and hardships of life. I'm wondering though, what does it look like? That closeness and peace? Is it all internal? _That all things are working for a great and glorious good.?_ I would love to keep the faith in these busy times. Would You reveal to me how I may remain in You.


## 1/23/08 - I perish. You Remain.

> This shall be written for the generation to come, and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD. Psalm 102:18

I was created by the Lord. He made me for His eternal purposes. The One who I serve is also the One who lives and created this entire universe.
This earth and establishment is temporary. Man has been repondent to the Glory that God has placed upon him.

But the World is also broken in it's pursuit of wealth, power, fame, significance, and identity.
But in this still God reigns supreme.

> Of old hast Thou laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Thy hands.
They shall perish, but Thou shalt endure; yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; and as a vesture shalt Thou change them, and they shall be changed.
But Thou art the same, and Thy years shall have no end.
Psalm 102: 25-27

Lord these issues, causes, and desires are short. We will spend eternity with You in Your perfect Kingdom. While we experience Life here, may You be glorified and drawing out Your Wisdom, truth, righteousness, knowledge, and understanding. Be glorified in my Marriage, Home, and Vocation.  Establish us in equity and Life that we may abound unto others.

Jon called me yesterday to talk about the design studio and such. He admitted that he stole my idea but then said he wants to build one for me. So While he doesn't know about Denver, he said that he would pay for us to move and get established in another city. Bless the Lord!


## 1/22/08 - An Supernatural Attitude

*Forgiveness*
After this plumbing fiasco I called my brother to explain how this whole thing was going down and how I was fighting with Jeff the plumber to pay for the siding etc etc. Steve reminded me that we who have been forgiven much should also do the same. That was one of the bigger thoughts that has given me peace in all of this.
Forgiveness is not some concept that is best used when things are happy and good. It is a supernatural attribute that only is revealed in pain and suffering.
_Lord, You have forgiven me greatly. Money is so temporary and You have even revealed the truth in carrying one another's burdens. May I live with a giving and open heart_

*Praise in Problems*
Aaron Peterson came up this weekend to help us fix the house up some before we rent it out. He made a comment that He wonders if God would want us to have a different perspective on pain, suffering, and problems to know that when those things happen, God is going to show up in a more intimtate way than when the good times are abounding.
So to begin to praise, pray, and look expantantly for God to show up in the trials. Believing that He wants to become more intimate with me during these times.
_May I be reminded Father of this now. That You're alive and well showing me new and glorious truths in these intoxicating and confusing times. Would I recognize Your presence by Your peace and other fruits of the Spirit._

> "Threfore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong." II Cor 12:10



*Money is temporary*
This concept that money is the point system of how we acquire wealth. I find that my performance cannot match the financial needs of our society. While I don't want to be in debt, I cannot take it with me. The Lord knows I want to be faithful with resources entrusted.
_Lord, would You lead us in the way we should go. Establish us in equity at the proper time. Would the formation of Christ Jesus be the center of
my hearts desire._

> "Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto Thee.
Hide not Thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline Thine ear unto me. In the day when I call, answer me speedily." _Psalm 102:1&2_

By Stepping out in desire, courage, newness, and unknown, I confess a higher degree of insecurity. I need You. I know You're here and You hear me. Since today all has not been completely restored, I want to


> My days are like a shadow that declineth, and I am withered like grass.
> But Thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever, and Thy remembrance unto all generations.  Psalm 102:11&12

Lord You alone reign supreme. While I will live with You in eternity I will know that You alone are the Life, Source, and Glory. I would ask for Your wisdom, knowledge, and understanding to be revealed in me as to what Your heart is for mine.

_Create in me a clean heart, and renew a pure and holy Spirit. Reveal Your Glory and Jesus's selfless love._


## 1/18/08 - O when wilt Thou Come to me.

I met up with Jon and Sy last night at the new office here in Nashville. I am pretty speechless about the whole matter. I've spent 3 years working out of my home, only for Sy to come in here 1 month after his department phases out, and to come in with a new office. Wow.
This only solidifies that we're done with this company. I put all I had into it and I get this kind of 'team' help. unbelievable.

> I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt Thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. Psalm 101:2

Lord, I just can't believe these guys. I feel like that was my vision, project, and passion. The last thing that would have kept me here. In them highjacking that, they have shut the door on my long term involvement with this company. I am furious.
But You have again protected me. I can't even imagine how I would feel if I didn't have them as plan B anyway.

Lord, I want to run my own successful, profitable business. What will it take for me to do so? Courage? A product? Money? Willingness to go into debt? I don't know what to do, honestly, so I'm going to the place where I pray and hope they teach me.

## 1/16/07 - Bring out the geek in me

I discovered last night that my accounting class was canceled for the semester. I was bummed but it's okay. I felt more I should take it out of obligation over desire.
I'm hoping to take Corporate Finance still though.

Also, I am still very much intrigued by all this IT. I'm trying to get the big picture so I can wrap my mind around what's going on here. I am starting to see how valuable some IT programing knowledge will do my skill set and future vocation. It can be the source of communication and as we continue in this new world.

So All these new languages are a great intellectual challenge and I have a goal to crack some codes and understanding by the time I start school.

Danae is concerned about the whole transition with the baby so we need to keep before the Lord about the timing of everything.

## 1/11/08 - I'm done with debt!

We met with the refi-guy last night. Seems that we're in pretty good position to get a good rate.

I had to change my mentality about debt and our lifestyle. Dave Ramsey has given us great contrast and realization that debt is bad. While we agree, I do not want to spend my life working for money, to either accumulate, or pay off.
We are keeping our spending to a minimum, it's just life is more expensive. Also, had we known all the answers and had all the wisdom we wouldn't be experiencing this. However, we had to learn it through trial and error.
So my resolve is that we're 34% debt to income ratio. It's not the best, but we still have some room.
We are making strides to increase my income and keeping our expenses low. The fact is we live in a consumer culture and everything costs money.

So I realized that I cannot be controlled by money. I'm not taking wealth with me, and I'm not taking debt either.

## 1/9/08

Over the last year or two I feel like I've been observing God and His ways more than asking Him to show up for one reason or another. It's been a quite season.
Now that I have a tight spot of home and moving, and baby will the Lord rescue us on time and in a solid way?
Those are the type of questions I'm fighting now. Why does my faith get stripped to the very core when there is actually some movement in my life?
_Lord, in my weak and feable life, I pray that I am honoring You. Would You show up today so I don't squander this moment in looking toward the future. I have no idea how many days we have here in TN, but You do. WOuld You give me the peace only You and Your infinite wisdom can bring. I know You love me and have given me freedom. I want to walk in Your ways. I want this life to live from the place higher than I could climb. I ask for You to handle the details and direction of moving, child preparation, and finances._


## 1/8

When I compare the amount of issues and things that we need to get done over the next 6 - 8 months, I'm finding that my faith is going to be tested. I'm reminded again of the story of Israel in their impasse with the Red Sea. They needed God to deliver a solution that they couldn't have ever produced.
_Lord, we have had a very peaceful time here at 904 Jones. I have enjoyed these mornings and lessons that You have revealed to and through me. I am requesting Your peace in these up coming months and Your guidance to work all these details out with the home and the move._

Part of the fear I have with Denver is this thought that I made a decision outside of Your will and as a result I'm going to have egg on my face with my friends, family, and wife. Since nothing was going on, I wanted to take advantage of these few precious months before life got even more full. The thought in my head is that You wanted me to remain here for something and I grew impatient.
While I like working, I don't like that we have no friends or real social activities here. I tried with all my might to make church clothes happen. That was the only real reason I considered this position. But now I know it's over and I'm over it.
_Lord, I will follow You wherever You want me to go. However, I also believe You made me a leader and that You do in fact speak to me through the courage You've given me. Life is more than here or there. I believe that. But I also want to dwell in the place that I have discovered my soul come alive in the quiet majestic awe of Your creation. I am willing to work hard, but I want to play and worship hard too!_

## 1/7

I spent half the day with Sam getting our plumbing pretty much back to normal. The Lord is merciful! It's really a weird concept asking the Lord for material or petty things. There is something about it that feels unspiritual and small.
During my time with Sam I asked him what he would do if he were in my situation. That is a very good question to get to know how someone thinks. His solutions were without faith or risk. His solution was, admittedly, pessimistic and didn't really demonstrate a way to take on more of life. His solution was one of minimizing debts and working hard regardless of how I make the money.
I know we're trying to take on more than we can chew. That is the faith part. I am leaving the unknowns in the Lords hands while we do what we can to focus on the days needs.
===
With Danae's sickness with the baby she has needed me to serve her with most everything. Food, cleaning, dogs, etc.
It is a perfect situation to reveal that I am not a caring, serving, and gentle, humble, giving person.

===
I have yet to write about the momentary experience I had on the golf course 2 weeks ago. As i was pulling in from 18 holes, I had this brief realization that it was God behind everything and that everything in existence was there because of God.
The wind was blowing, the temperature was perfect, the people were enjoying themselves and it was like the scene in the matrix in that I was seeing things more than they really were. It was surreal.

Thinking about it again, and reading verses like:
_For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the LORD made the heavens. Psalm 96:5_
I just have to wonder if I have any idea who I'm dealing with. The power, insight, and reality of God who is real, here, and the Lord of my life.

One of the truths I want to grasp is that God and Christ are holding me together. The power of God is in me, not outside of me. That this journey is a realization, revelation, and exposure of what is already inside me. The only reason more doesn't happen or occur is I am in the way, or that it's not God's will b/c the certain aspects of myself are unnecessary at the moment.
===
_Father am I devoted to You? Do I live my life in surrender to the fact that I am not my own? Am I chasing my own will or Thine? I pointed toward MBA, Denver b/c my heart comes alive when I am in the wild. I love to learn, and we never seemed to get rooted here. I am not implying that that couldn't happen intentionally for a season here, but that is what has me taking advantage of the time to shift into gear.
I want to work, live, play, commune, serve, and live Life. Lord may I walk openly. Would You handle the details of transition. Would you be glorified in my mind, soul, and heart, body._

===
I keep justifying downloading software for free because I'm a student. Students would get free software, so I'm wondering if i should look into that. I don't like that I'm stealing it.

===

_Lord let this day be unto Your Glory. Would You create in me a clean heart. Would You be the one who draws love and gentleness toward Danae while we're in this small space. I ask You to look favorably on my work and labor. Lead me in Your ways of truth, righteousness, wisdom, and an increase in equity._
