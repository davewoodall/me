      How it feels outside of my comfort zone.
    </h1>

    <p class='p'>About three months ago I was learning different ways people determine which day is the Sabbath. Some claim it’s the 7th day on the Gregorian calendar. Others claim it’s the 7th day after a New Moon which means the Sabbath is not strictly on Saturday. Both sides have compelling arguments. As an aspiring Torah observer, I was torn on which day to honor the Sabbath.</p>

    <p class='p'>Around that same time I came across the term Cognitive Dissonance.</p>

    <dl class="def cog-dis">
      <dt>Cognitive Dissonance</dt>
      <dd>the state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes, especially as relating to behavioral decisions and attitude change. <cite><a href="#">New Oxford Dictionary</a></cite></dd>
    </dl>

    <p class='p'>Cognitive dissonance describes the land in between convictions and clarity. While the definition was clarifying of what I was experiencing, I found the realization to be troubling. I want to know what the truth is and it bothers me that I can have two seemingly right ideas at odds with one another</p>

    <p class='p'>I’ve had some time to accept that cognitive dissonance is a real thing. It is a requirement if I am to grow. It means that the ways I am changing are not simply within my own comfort zone</p>
