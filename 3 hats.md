# 3 hats
I started to realize there are at least 3 different hats I’m wearing now as a developer. There’s the aspiring Senior Software Developer self who wants to practice constantly. I want to make sure I’m not learning or doing any bad habits.

Then, there’s the entrepreneur hat that wants to ship something and doesn’t want to worry about what the code looks like. I just want to show off something to people who care least about the plumbing. 

Lastly, there’s the guy who wants to stay gainfully employed. Which means, I want to spend a little time developing assets that promote me and my skills. Like, writing this post. This is part rant but also part glorified _Lorem Ipsum_. Because those who are looking at me, the job candidate just want to see that I am doing more than watching Netflix with my free time. _I’m blogging, bitches!_
