# Culture Differences

My first web app experience was Ruby on Rails. Rails is convention over configuration. That has been great and challenging at the same time. Every thing 'just works'. But the problem with that is I don't know how it works. Knowing how things work is essentially the true responsibilities of an employee. Rails provides tremendous power but the price is understanding. It hides all the details. This is great for the individual who is recreational, experienced. At least this was my experience. I worked many startups when anyone who was willing to try to code was hired. I learned from first hand, paid experience how much I wasn't taught in code school. My employments were roughtly 3 month contract jobs because that was all I knew, or sadly, how long it took for them to realize how little I knew. This is not a rejection of Rails. This speaks of the sophisticated nature of the tool.

At the end of the day, sofware is written for dollars. Dollars are generated by business. Thus it stands to reason, that software is made for business.

Last month I was tasked with learning Vue for the company. I had spent some recreational time learning backbone and angular 1 but found all the configuration to be daunting. Thankfully, that prepared me at some level for what JavaScript was going to do. The amount of configuration was head-spinning. It is the opposite of the rails way; configuration over convention.

But now I'm beginning to see that this JS community is going to help my Rails. Because I see now that everything has a configuration. Rails just hides it.

I don't want Rails to turn into this configuration process. I just wanted to know how rails worked. No, actually, I really wanted to know how the _web_ worked. from _URL to SQL_.

JS is helping me see the many decisions that are required to make things work. Including things like the real difference between a development and production environment. Rails spoiled me to see how many little decisions need to be set. From hot reloading, debugging, minification, file compression, etc. This JS ecosystem is teaching me about all of these.
